1,"In graph theory, several fundamental tasks are crucial for various applications. Shortest Path algorithms, like Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford, help find the minimum distance between nodes in a weighted graph, playing a key role in routing and network design. Hamiltonian Cycle detection determines whether a cycle exists that visits each vertex exactly once, a problem common in scheduling and logistics. Subgraph Matching focuses on finding a smaller graph pattern within a larger graph, widely used in chemical informatics and pattern recognition. These tasks, along with Graph Coloring, Spanning Trees, and Maximum Flow, demonstrate the diversity and utility of analyzing graph structures. With the rise of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), new ways of addressing graph-based tasks, like node classification, link prediction, and clustering, have emerged, allowing models to learn from the inherent relationships in graph-structured data.
