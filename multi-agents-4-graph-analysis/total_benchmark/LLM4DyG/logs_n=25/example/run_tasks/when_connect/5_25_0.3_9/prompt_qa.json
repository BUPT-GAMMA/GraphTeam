    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 5, 0), (0, 18, 0), (1, 7, 0), (1, 12, 0), (1, 21, 0), (2, 4, 0), (2, 8, 0), (2, 17, 0), (2, 23, 0), (3, 16, 0), (3, 24, 0), (4, 11, 0), (5, 14, 0), (6, 9, 0), (6, 12, 0), (6, 15, 0), (7, 10, 0), (7, 14, 0), (7, 18, 0), (7, 22, 0), (10, 14, 0), (12, 14, 0), (12, 24, 0), (13, 18, 0), (13, 22, 0), (14, 15, 0), (15, 18, 0), (16, 24, 0), (22, 23, 0), (23, 24, 0), (0, 11, 1), (1, 3, 1), (1, 9, 1), (2, 20, 1), (3, 11, 1), (4, 8, 1), (4, 20, 1), (8, 11, 1), (11, 19, 1), (11, 24, 1), (12, 23, 1), (17, 20, 1), (18, 19, 1), (1, 2, 2), (1, 23, 2), (2, 5, 2), (2, 15, 2), (4, 15, 2), (5, 11, 2), (5, 13, 2), (5, 22, 2), (6, 11, 2), (8, 18, 2), (9, 23, 2), (10, 17, 2), (10, 18, 2), (10, 22, 2), (11, 21, 2), (11, 23, 2), (13, 15, 2), (13, 21, 2), (15, 20, 2), (20, 21, 2), (0, 8, 3), (0, 17, 3), (1, 8, 3), (1, 18, 3), (2, 24, 3), (3, 6, 3), (3, 9, 3), (4, 13, 3), (5, 20, 3), (7, 12, 3), (7, 17, 3), (8, 24, 3), (9, 18, 3), (11, 13, 3), (12, 13, 3), (14, 16, 3), (14, 17, 3), (16, 19, 3), (0, 3, 4), (0, 16, 4), (1, 10, 4), (1, 15, 4), (2, 6, 4), (2, 9, 4), (4, 23, 4), (5, 16, 4), (5, 21, 4), (6, 21, 4), (7, 9, 4), (7, 16, 4), (9, 14, 4), (10, 15, 4), (13, 19, 4), (16, 18, 4), (17, 22, 4), (19, 22, 4)].
