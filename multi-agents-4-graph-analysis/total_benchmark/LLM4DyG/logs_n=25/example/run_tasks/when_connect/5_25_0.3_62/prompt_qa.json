    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 4, 0), (1, 16, 0), (2, 12, 0), (2, 21, 0), (2, 24, 0), (4, 8, 0), (4, 24, 0), (5, 13, 0), (7, 8, 0), (9, 14, 0), (9, 15, 0), (10, 12, 0), (10, 23, 0), (13, 15, 0), (0, 9, 1), (0, 12, 1), (0, 21, 1), (1, 11, 1), (1, 12, 1), (1, 18, 1), (3, 12, 1), (3, 17, 1), (3, 21, 1), (4, 5, 1), (5, 20, 1), (6, 20, 1), (7, 22, 1), (10, 11, 1), (13, 16, 1), (14, 17, 1), (15, 22, 1), (17, 21, 1), (17, 24, 1), (0, 2, 2), (0, 20, 2), (2, 13, 2), (2, 17, 2), (3, 19, 2), (4, 20, 2), (6, 19, 2), (9, 16, 2), (10, 14, 2), (11, 13, 2), (11, 18, 2), (11, 19, 2), (12, 22, 2), (13, 17, 2), (13, 20, 2), (13, 21, 2), (14, 15, 2), (15, 21, 2), (15, 23, 2), (0, 13, 3), (0, 19, 3), (1, 17, 3), (2, 15, 3), (4, 6, 3), (4, 16, 3), (5, 16, 3), (5, 17, 3), (6, 23, 3), (7, 16, 3), (7, 24, 3), (8, 14, 3), (8, 21, 3), (9, 21, 3), (10, 13, 3), (12, 18, 3), (14, 16, 3), (14, 20, 3), (16, 21, 3), (1, 8, 4), (3, 15, 4), (4, 9, 4), (4, 12, 4), (8, 9, 4), (9, 13, 4), (9, 19, 4), (11, 17, 4), (11, 23, 4), (12, 15, 4), (12, 16, 4), (18, 24, 4), (20, 23, 4), (23, 24, 4)].
