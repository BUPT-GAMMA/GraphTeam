    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 5, 0), (1, 8, 0), (1, 24, 0), (2, 19, 0), (2, 22, 0), (3, 11, 0), (4, 24, 0), (6, 22, 0), (7, 13, 0), (8, 12, 0), (11, 12, 0), (14, 18, 0), (15, 24, 0), (17, 18, 0), (0, 8, 1), (0, 21, 1), (0, 23, 1), (2, 20, 1), (2, 21, 1), (5, 17, 1), (5, 19, 1), (5, 22, 1), (6, 19, 1), (7, 12, 1), (8, 10, 1), (8, 20, 1), (8, 23, 1), (9, 22, 1), (10, 14, 1), (13, 17, 1), (14, 15, 1), (14, 20, 1), (14, 23, 1), (15, 23, 1), (18, 23, 1), (18, 24, 1), (23, 24, 1), (0, 24, 2), (1, 13, 2), (1, 23, 2), (3, 15, 2), (3, 16, 2), (3, 17, 2), (4, 7, 2), (6, 9, 2), (6, 20, 2), (8, 19, 2), (8, 21, 2), (9, 24, 2), (10, 16, 2), (14, 16, 2), (20, 22, 2), (20, 24, 2), (0, 2, 3), (0, 14, 3), (2, 7, 3), (2, 10, 3), (3, 6, 3), (4, 16, 3), (4, 23, 3), (5, 9, 3), (5, 11, 3), (5, 12, 3), (5, 15, 3), (6, 12, 3), (7, 18, 3), (8, 11, 3), (9, 13, 3), (10, 11, 3), (11, 13, 3), (11, 17, 3), (11, 21, 3), (13, 19, 3), (15, 20, 3), (17, 20, 3), (17, 21, 3), (0, 17, 4), (1, 10, 4), (1, 12, 4), (1, 14, 4), (2, 14, 4), (2, 17, 4), (3, 23, 4), (6, 8, 4), (8, 13, 4), (8, 14, 4), (10, 19, 4), (14, 24, 4), (19, 20, 4), (22, 23, 4)].
