    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 3, 0), (0, 20, 0), (1, 24, 0), (4, 6, 0), (4, 12, 0), (4, 18, 0), (5, 7, 0), (5, 13, 0), (5, 24, 0), (6, 13, 0), (6, 16, 0), (7, 9, 0), (7, 16, 0), (10, 23, 0), (11, 24, 0), (13, 22, 0), (13, 24, 0), (16, 20, 0), (16, 22, 0), (22, 23, 0), (0, 9, 1), (1, 6, 1), (2, 20, 1), (2, 21, 1), (5, 10, 1), (6, 9, 1), (6, 21, 1), (6, 24, 1), (13, 18, 1), (15, 19, 1), (15, 24, 1), (17, 18, 1), (21, 22, 1), (0, 16, 2), (1, 17, 2), (2, 8, 2), (2, 22, 2), (3, 5, 2), (4, 24, 2), (5, 12, 2), (6, 20, 2), (7, 11, 2), (7, 12, 2), (7, 18, 2), (8, 18, 2), (9, 14, 2), (9, 17, 2), (9, 21, 2), (12, 21, 2), (1, 5, 3), (1, 9, 3), (1, 12, 3), (2, 5, 3), (2, 12, 3), (2, 17, 3), (2, 24, 3), (3, 8, 3), (6, 17, 3), (6, 22, 3), (8, 13, 3), (8, 19, 3), (8, 24, 3), (10, 16, 3), (10, 20, 3), (10, 24, 3), (11, 20, 3), (11, 23, 3), (12, 16, 3), (12, 20, 3), (15, 17, 3), (15, 22, 3), (16, 23, 3), (20, 21, 3), (0, 1, 4), (3, 9, 4), (3, 12, 4), (4, 7, 4), (4, 17, 4), (5, 6, 4), (5, 21, 4), (5, 22, 4), (6, 7, 4), (6, 11, 4), (9, 20, 4), (11, 14, 4), (11, 15, 4), (14, 21, 4), (14, 23, 4), (17, 23, 4), (17, 24, 4), (21, 24, 4)].
