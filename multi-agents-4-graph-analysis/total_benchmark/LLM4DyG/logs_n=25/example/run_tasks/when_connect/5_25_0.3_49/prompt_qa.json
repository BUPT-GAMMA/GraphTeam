    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 3, 0), (1, 9, 0), (2, 14, 0), (2, 20, 0), (4, 24, 0), (6, 13, 0), (6, 19, 0), (7, 11, 0), (9, 22, 0), (10, 13, 0), (10, 14, 0), (11, 24, 0), (12, 19, 0), (14, 16, 0), (15, 23, 0), (17, 19, 0), (18, 24, 0), (19, 22, 0), (0, 18, 1), (2, 4, 1), (3, 6, 1), (5, 6, 1), (6, 12, 1), (6, 20, 1), (8, 11, 1), (9, 11, 1), (10, 12, 1), (10, 24, 1), (12, 14, 1), (12, 15, 1), (12, 16, 1), (13, 18, 1), (13, 24, 1), (14, 18, 1), (18, 19, 1), (0, 1, 2), (0, 7, 2), (0, 22, 2), (1, 13, 2), (1, 24, 2), (4, 23, 2), (5, 20, 2), (5, 22, 2), (6, 14, 2), (7, 15, 2), (7, 18, 2), (7, 22, 2), (8, 9, 2), (8, 16, 2), (8, 17, 2), (8, 18, 2), (8, 22, 2), (9, 10, 2), (11, 19, 2), (12, 23, 2), (12, 24, 2), (15, 19, 2), (17, 24, 2), (18, 22, 2), (1, 14, 3), (2, 3, 3), (2, 17, 3), (3, 15, 3), (5, 14, 3), (6, 11, 3), (7, 8, 3), (7, 10, 3), (7, 14, 3), (7, 21, 3), (9, 12, 3), (9, 18, 3), (9, 23, 3), (10, 21, 3), (11, 17, 3), (14, 22, 3), (15, 20, 3), (17, 23, 3), (19, 24, 3), (23, 24, 3), (0, 6, 4), (0, 9, 4), (0, 17, 4), (1, 6, 4), (1, 8, 4), (2, 7, 4), (2, 13, 4), (3, 16, 4), (3, 19, 4), (4, 6, 4), (4, 12, 4), (5, 15, 4), (5, 16, 4), (6, 23, 4), (8, 15, 4), (8, 24, 4), (14, 17, 4), (17, 18, 4), (18, 20, 4)].
