    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 2, 0), (0, 10, 0), (0, 15, 0), (0, 21, 0), (2, 8, 0), (2, 14, 0), (3, 9, 0), (4, 6, 0), (5, 12, 0), (5, 21, 0), (6, 15, 0), (6, 20, 0), (8, 9, 0), (9, 12, 0), (9, 18, 0), (9, 21, 0), (10, 19, 0), (10, 23, 0), (12, 16, 0), (13, 18, 0), (13, 19, 0), (15, 24, 0), (17, 22, 0), (0, 12, 1), (0, 16, 1), (1, 2, 1), (1, 13, 1), (3, 23, 1), (4, 16, 1), (5, 17, 1), (7, 24, 1), (8, 17, 1), (9, 24, 1), (10, 18, 1), (11, 14, 1), (12, 24, 1), (13, 23, 1), (14, 18, 1), (14, 20, 1), (17, 19, 1), (17, 24, 1), (18, 22, 1), (1, 14, 2), (1, 18, 2), (1, 20, 2), (1, 23, 2), (2, 6, 2), (3, 13, 2), (5, 7, 2), (5, 15, 2), (6, 14, 2), (8, 14, 2), (10, 12, 2), (11, 21, 2), (11, 23, 2), (13, 22, 2), (14, 16, 2), (14, 23, 2), (16, 23, 2), (18, 19, 2), (2, 12, 3), (2, 19, 3), (3, 18, 3), (4, 7, 3), (4, 10, 3), (4, 13, 3), (5, 13, 3), (8, 20, 3), (9, 20, 3), (11, 19, 3), (12, 23, 3), (19, 21, 3), (19, 24, 3), (22, 24, 3), (1, 16, 4), (2, 18, 4), (4, 15, 4), (5, 8, 4), (5, 22, 4), (5, 23, 4), (6, 16, 4), (6, 17, 4), (7, 13, 4), (7, 23, 4), (8, 16, 4), (9, 22, 4), (13, 17, 4), (14, 21, 4), (18, 20, 4)].
