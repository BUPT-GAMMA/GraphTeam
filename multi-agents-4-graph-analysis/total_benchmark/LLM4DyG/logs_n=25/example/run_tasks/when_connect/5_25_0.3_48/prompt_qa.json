    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 2, 0), (0, 16, 0), (0, 17, 0), (0, 21, 0), (0, 24, 0), (1, 12, 0), (3, 17, 0), (5, 8, 0), (6, 8, 0), (9, 10, 0), (12, 13, 0), (12, 21, 0), (13, 20, 0), (17, 21, 0), (21, 23, 0), (0, 8, 1), (1, 22, 1), (3, 16, 1), (6, 11, 1), (6, 16, 1), (7, 11, 1), (7, 14, 1), (8, 13, 1), (10, 24, 1), (11, 16, 1), (14, 20, 1), (19, 20, 1), (19, 22, 1), (0, 18, 2), (1, 10, 2), (1, 16, 2), (1, 18, 2), (1, 19, 2), (1, 21, 2), (2, 10, 2), (2, 22, 2), (2, 23, 2), (3, 19, 2), (4, 11, 2), (4, 16, 2), (4, 17, 2), (5, 7, 2), (6, 10, 2), (7, 22, 2), (8, 17, 2), (8, 21, 2), (9, 20, 2), (15, 18, 2), (17, 22, 2), (18, 24, 2), (20, 21, 2), (20, 22, 2), (0, 6, 3), (0, 13, 3), (1, 5, 3), (2, 15, 3), (4, 22, 3), (5, 13, 3), (5, 17, 3), (5, 18, 3), (6, 14, 3), (7, 8, 3), (8, 18, 3), (8, 22, 3), (11, 24, 3), (12, 17, 3), (13, 22, 3), (14, 17, 3), (16, 24, 3), (17, 23, 3), (0, 11, 4), (0, 19, 4), (0, 22, 4), (1, 9, 4), (1, 23, 4), (2, 17, 4), (2, 24, 4), (3, 18, 4), (3, 22, 4), (4, 7, 4), (4, 18, 4), (4, 21, 4), (5, 24, 4), (7, 9, 4), (7, 13, 4), (7, 18, 4), (8, 19, 4), (9, 14, 4), (9, 22, 4), (10, 17, 4), (13, 19, 4), (17, 19, 4)].
