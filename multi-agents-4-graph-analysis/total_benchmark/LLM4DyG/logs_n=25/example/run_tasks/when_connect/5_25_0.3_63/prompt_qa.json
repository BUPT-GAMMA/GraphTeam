    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 9, 0), (0, 17, 0), (2, 5, 0), (2, 11, 0), (2, 16, 0), (2, 21, 0), (4, 8, 0), (5, 20, 0), (5, 24, 0), (7, 8, 0), (7, 23, 0), (8, 11, 0), (8, 20, 0), (9, 18, 0), (10, 12, 0), (11, 14, 0), (12, 13, 0), (12, 15, 0), (12, 17, 0), (12, 24, 0), (13, 23, 0), (14, 23, 0), (14, 24, 0), (17, 23, 0), (0, 13, 1), (2, 24, 1), (3, 7, 1), (3, 10, 1), (4, 16, 1), (6, 12, 1), (6, 24, 1), (7, 16, 1), (8, 22, 1), (9, 21, 1), (13, 18, 1), (15, 19, 1), (16, 19, 1), (16, 21, 1), (17, 21, 1), (19, 20, 1), (0, 8, 2), (1, 5, 2), (2, 4, 2), (2, 17, 2), (3, 16, 2), (4, 11, 2), (5, 9, 2), (5, 17, 2), (6, 16, 2), (6, 19, 2), (7, 12, 2), (7, 13, 2), (7, 14, 2), (8, 15, 2), (9, 17, 2), (11, 13, 2), (12, 20, 2), (19, 22, 2), (20, 22, 2), (0, 7, 3), (0, 23, 3), (1, 21, 3), (3, 5, 3), (5, 15, 3), (6, 13, 3), (7, 21, 3), (10, 13, 3), (10, 21, 3), (12, 23, 3), (13, 17, 3), (13, 20, 3), (13, 21, 3), (17, 24, 3), (23, 24, 3), (0, 2, 4), (0, 5, 4), (1, 7, 4), (1, 11, 4), (3, 13, 4), (3, 19, 4), (4, 5, 4), (5, 8, 4), (5, 11, 4), (5, 18, 4), (7, 20, 4), (8, 18, 4), (10, 24, 4), (12, 19, 4), (13, 15, 4), (15, 20, 4), (16, 23, 4), (22, 23, 4)].
