    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether three nodes in the dynamic graph formed a closed triad. A closed triad is composed of three nodes which have linked with each other some time. \nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 13, 0), (0, 16, 0), (0, 17, 0), (2, 10, 0), (4, 7, 0), (4, 22, 0), (5, 15, 0), (7, 11, 0), (9, 22, 0), (10, 12, 0), (10, 14, 0), (12, 16, 0), (14, 15, 0), (15, 23, 0), (18, 21, 0), (23, 24, 0), (0, 5, 1), (0, 6, 1), (0, 22, 1), (1, 16, 1), (2, 11, 1), (2, 22, 1), (3, 11, 1), (3, 14, 1), (5, 19, 1), (7, 10, 1), (7, 15, 1), (7, 22, 1), (9, 24, 1), (10, 15, 1), (11, 12, 1), (15, 24, 1), (0, 8, 2), (1, 2, 2), (1, 21, 2), (2, 4, 2), (2, 20, 2), (3, 6, 2), (3, 8, 2), (4, 16, 2), (4, 24, 2), (6, 15, 2), (6, 19, 2), (6, 22, 2), (7, 21, 2), (8, 16, 2), (8, 18, 2), (12, 21, 2), (13, 15, 2), (14, 22, 2), (18, 19, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 15, 3), (0, 23, 3), (1, 12, 3), (1, 24, 3), (2, 14, 3), (2, 19, 3), (3, 17, 3), (3, 24, 3), (4, 5, 3), (5, 12, 3), (5, 23, 3), (6, 13, 3), (8, 23, 3), (9, 21, 3), (14, 23, 3), (15, 18, 3), (15, 19, 3), (15, 20, 3), (17, 22, 3), (0, 3, 4), (0, 18, 4), (1, 13, 4), (2, 18, 4), (3, 19, 4), (4, 6, 4), (4, 14, 4), (4, 15, 4), (5, 7, 4), (5, 20, 4), (6, 12, 4), (10, 18, 4), (12, 13, 4), (14, 19, 4), (15, 21, 4)].
