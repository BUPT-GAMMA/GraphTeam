    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether three nodes in the dynamic graph formed a closed triad. A closed triad is composed of three nodes which have linked with each other some time. \nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 17, 0), (2, 3, 0), (2, 11, 0), (2, 12, 0), (2, 17, 0), (5, 19, 0), (6, 13, 0), (7, 14, 0), (9, 17, 0), (9, 19, 0), (10, 22, 0), (12, 14, 0), (12, 15, 0), (13, 22, 0), (16, 21, 0), (21, 22, 0), (0, 10, 1), (0, 17, 1), (1, 16, 1), (4, 18, 1), (7, 18, 1), (8, 18, 1), (9, 14, 1), (9, 21, 1), (10, 24, 1), (11, 14, 1), (11, 20, 1), (13, 19, 1), (14, 18, 1), (16, 20, 1), (17, 22, 1), (19, 22, 1), (21, 23, 1), (0, 12, 2), (0, 13, 2), (1, 5, 2), (1, 11, 2), (2, 13, 2), (3, 5, 2), (3, 16, 2), (3, 18, 2), (3, 19, 2), (4, 5, 2), (4, 14, 2), (5, 12, 2), (6, 8, 2), (6, 9, 2), (8, 13, 2), (9, 13, 2), (10, 21, 2), (11, 17, 2), (12, 20, 2), (18, 20, 2), (18, 21, 2), (19, 23, 2), (23, 24, 2), (0, 19, 3), (1, 3, 3), (2, 9, 3), (2, 10, 3), (4, 8, 3), (7, 8, 3), (9, 12, 3), (11, 23, 3), (12, 19, 3), (12, 21, 3), (13, 24, 3), (14, 16, 3), (15, 17, 3), (15, 18, 3), (16, 22, 3), (0, 18, 4), (1, 18, 4), (2, 8, 4), (2, 14, 4), (3, 13, 4), (7, 12, 4), (7, 16, 4), (7, 17, 4), (8, 11, 4), (9, 10, 4), (10, 12, 4), (10, 15, 4), (12, 16, 4), (13, 14, 4), (17, 18, 4), (22, 23, 4)].
