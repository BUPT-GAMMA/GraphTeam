    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether three nodes in the dynamic graph formed a closed triad. A closed triad is composed of three nodes which have linked with each other some time. \nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 19, 0), (0, 24, 0), (1, 16, 0), (1, 22, 0), (2, 20, 0), (3, 15, 0), (3, 19, 0), (4, 21, 0), (5, 19, 0), (6, 8, 0), (8, 11, 0), (9, 21, 0), (10, 11, 0), (10, 21, 0), (15, 23, 0), (15, 24, 0), (20, 24, 0), (1, 3, 1), (1, 5, 1), (1, 20, 1), (2, 13, 1), (6, 10, 1), (6, 18, 1), (6, 23, 1), (7, 23, 1), (12, 23, 1), (12, 24, 1), (13, 21, 1), (15, 19, 1), (15, 21, 1), (17, 19, 1), (17, 22, 1), (18, 19, 1), (20, 23, 1), (0, 11, 2), (3, 11, 2), (3, 12, 2), (3, 16, 2), (4, 7, 2), (5, 10, 2), (5, 20, 2), (6, 7, 2), (8, 19, 2), (10, 18, 2), (12, 21, 2), (16, 22, 2), (17, 23, 2), (18, 21, 2), (18, 24, 2), (0, 4, 3), (1, 19, 3), (2, 14, 3), (2, 16, 3), (3, 14, 3), (3, 18, 3), (3, 20, 3), (3, 21, 3), (6, 15, 3), (7, 8, 3), (7, 14, 3), (7, 22, 3), (8, 12, 3), (8, 20, 3), (9, 19, 3), (10, 16, 3), (10, 23, 3), (11, 15, 3), (12, 18, 3), (13, 24, 3), (17, 21, 3), (19, 24, 3), (0, 9, 4), (2, 19, 4), (3, 6, 4), (3, 24, 4), (4, 17, 4), (4, 19, 4), (5, 22, 4), (6, 22, 4), (7, 11, 4), (7, 12, 4), (7, 17, 4), (8, 13, 4), (9, 14, 4), (9, 20, 4), (10, 12, 4), (11, 23, 4), (11, 24, 4), (12, 19, 4), (13, 17, 4), (13, 19, 4), (13, 23, 4), (14, 23, 4), (16, 20, 4), (18, 20, 4), (21, 23, 4)].
