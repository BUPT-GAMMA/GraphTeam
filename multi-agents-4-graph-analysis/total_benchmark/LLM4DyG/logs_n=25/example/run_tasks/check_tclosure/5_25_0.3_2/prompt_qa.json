    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether three nodes in the dynamic graph formed a closed triad. A closed triad is composed of three nodes which have linked with each other some time. \nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 3, 0), (0, 4, 0), (0, 22, 0), (4, 15, 0), (4, 24, 0), (5, 20, 0), (6, 21, 0), (7, 9, 0), (8, 12, 0), (8, 16, 0), (8, 21, 0), (8, 24, 0), (10, 17, 0), (11, 17, 0), (14, 20, 0), (15, 23, 0), (16, 17, 0), (16, 23, 0), (16, 24, 0), (1, 7, 1), (4, 5, 1), (4, 21, 1), (5, 18, 1), (6, 17, 1), (6, 23, 1), (7, 12, 1), (7, 13, 1), (7, 14, 1), (9, 24, 1), (10, 22, 1), (11, 19, 1), (11, 20, 1), (11, 23, 1), (18, 23, 1), (0, 20, 2), (1, 6, 2), (1, 13, 2), (3, 16, 2), (3, 24, 2), (4, 7, 2), (4, 23, 2), (5, 11, 2), (5, 14, 2), (6, 11, 2), (6, 14, 2), (7, 11, 2), (7, 21, 2), (8, 18, 2), (8, 20, 2), (8, 23, 2), (9, 14, 2), (10, 20, 2), (12, 13, 2), (12, 20, 2), (13, 23, 2), (14, 21, 2), (17, 22, 2), (20, 22, 2), (0, 12, 3), (0, 21, 3), (1, 9, 3), (2, 23, 3), (3, 20, 3), (3, 22, 3), (4, 11, 3), (4, 19, 3), (7, 23, 3), (8, 15, 3), (10, 11, 3), (12, 21, 3), (14, 23, 3), (15, 20, 3), (16, 18, 3), (16, 22, 3), (18, 20, 3), (20, 24, 3), (1, 23, 4), (2, 18, 4), (2, 21, 4), (3, 12, 4), (4, 10, 4), (4, 17, 4), (5, 7, 4), (5, 8, 4), (5, 13, 4), (7, 15, 4), (8, 22, 4), (9, 21, 4), (11, 13, 4), (12, 19, 4), (13, 15, 4), (21, 24, 4)].
