    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 9, 0), (1, 23, 0), (3, 5, 0), (3, 8, 0), (3, 13, 0), (3, 22, 0), (8, 15, 0), (8, 16, 0), (9, 10, 0), (9, 13, 0), (10, 12, 0), (10, 21, 0), (11, 23, 0), (12, 18, 0), (12, 19, 0), (12, 23, 0), (13, 16, 0), (14, 20, 0), (15, 19, 0), (15, 22, 0), (17, 21, 0), (18, 24, 0), (20, 23, 0), (0, 21, 1), (1, 14, 1), (2, 4, 1), (2, 5, 1), (2, 19, 1), (2, 23, 1), (3, 9, 1), (5, 14, 1), (6, 7, 1), (6, 15, 1), (8, 18, 1), (9, 19, 1), (11, 24, 1), (12, 17, 1), (14, 18, 1), (15, 18, 1), (17, 19, 1), (0, 7, 2), (1, 2, 2), (1, 6, 2), (3, 15, 2), (3, 24, 2), (4, 7, 2), (6, 21, 2), (7, 18, 2), (9, 14, 2), (10, 14, 2), (19, 23, 2), (20, 21, 2), (2, 3, 3), (2, 14, 3), (2, 17, 3), (3, 7, 3), (3, 19, 3), (5, 6, 3), (6, 20, 3), (9, 22, 3), (11, 18, 3), (13, 15, 3), (13, 21, 3), (16, 22, 3), (17, 23, 3), (1, 10, 4), (1, 20, 4), (2, 6, 4), (2, 7, 4), (2, 8, 4), (2, 22, 4), (4, 18, 4), (4, 20, 4), (7, 16, 4), (8, 10, 4), (8, 11, 4), (11, 12, 4), (11, 13, 4), (14, 15, 4), (15, 23, 4), (16, 17, 4), (16, 18, 4), (18, 21, 4), (19, 24, 4)].
