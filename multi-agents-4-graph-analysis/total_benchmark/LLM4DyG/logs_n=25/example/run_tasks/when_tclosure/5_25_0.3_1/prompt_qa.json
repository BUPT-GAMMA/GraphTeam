    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 9, 0), (0, 17, 0), (0, 20, 0), (3, 12, 0), (4, 18, 0), (5, 10, 0), (5, 16, 0), (5, 23, 0), (6, 18, 0), (7, 13, 0), (8, 13, 0), (9, 22, 0), (11, 21, 0), (11, 23, 0), (13, 18, 0), (14, 17, 0), (15, 18, 0), (15, 20, 0), (16, 21, 0), (19, 22, 0), (22, 24, 0), (0, 10, 1), (0, 21, 1), (1, 5, 1), (3, 6, 1), (3, 7, 1), (3, 18, 1), (3, 23, 1), (4, 6, 1), (4, 15, 1), (5, 9, 1), (5, 21, 1), (6, 9, 1), (6, 10, 1), (6, 21, 1), (7, 19, 1), (8, 23, 1), (9, 15, 1), (10, 11, 1), (10, 20, 1), (12, 20, 1), (14, 18, 1), (14, 19, 1), (18, 23, 1), (1, 8, 2), (1, 10, 2), (1, 20, 2), (2, 13, 2), (5, 20, 2), (7, 11, 2), (7, 23, 2), (8, 24, 2), (9, 11, 2), (11, 24, 2), (12, 14, 2), (13, 17, 2), (15, 23, 2), (20, 23, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 14, 3), (1, 13, 3), (5, 19, 3), (5, 24, 3), (6, 12, 3), (6, 22, 3), (7, 15, 3), (10, 12, 3), (10, 19, 3), (11, 12, 3), (13, 14, 3), (14, 24, 3), (16, 19, 3), (16, 20, 3), (16, 23, 3), (17, 22, 3), (0, 4, 4), (1, 2, 4), (1, 4, 4), (1, 9, 4), (1, 12, 4), (1, 17, 4), (2, 12, 4), (2, 16, 4), (5, 8, 4), (6, 13, 4), (7, 8, 4), (7, 12, 4), (8, 14, 4), (10, 14, 4), (13, 16, 4), (15, 21, 4), (15, 24, 4), (17, 21, 4), (17, 24, 4), (18, 20, 4), (18, 21, 4), (20, 22, 4)].
