    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 15, 0), (1, 2, 0), (1, 6, 0), (1, 12, 0), (2, 10, 0), (2, 12, 0), (3, 5, 0), (3, 13, 0), (3, 16, 0), (4, 14, 0), (4, 16, 0), (4, 20, 0), (4, 21, 0), (6, 7, 0), (6, 9, 0), (9, 23, 0), (13, 18, 0), (14, 23, 0), (20, 22, 0), (0, 4, 1), (0, 12, 1), (0, 16, 1), (3, 17, 1), (3, 20, 1), (4, 17, 1), (5, 22, 1), (6, 15, 1), (7, 8, 1), (7, 18, 1), (8, 9, 1), (8, 14, 1), (8, 21, 1), (11, 18, 1), (11, 19, 1), (21, 23, 1), (0, 22, 2), (0, 24, 2), (1, 19, 2), (3, 15, 2), (5, 21, 2), (8, 24, 2), (9, 11, 2), (9, 12, 2), (9, 22, 2), (15, 16, 2), (15, 17, 2), (16, 19, 2), (21, 24, 2), (0, 7, 3), (0, 9, 3), (1, 13, 3), (1, 22, 3), (3, 10, 3), (3, 23, 3), (4, 9, 3), (4, 15, 3), (5, 23, 3), (6, 12, 3), (6, 16, 3), (6, 19, 3), (6, 24, 3), (7, 10, 3), (7, 12, 3), (7, 16, 3), (7, 23, 3), (9, 10, 3), (9, 20, 3), (9, 21, 3), (10, 22, 3), (11, 23, 3), (13, 16, 3), (13, 17, 3), (13, 22, 3), (15, 19, 3), (16, 21, 3), (21, 22, 3), (0, 2, 4), (0, 11, 4), (1, 3, 4), (1, 11, 4), (2, 5, 4), (2, 7, 4), (3, 19, 4), (5, 11, 4), (5, 18, 4), (5, 20, 4), (6, 8, 4), (6, 10, 4), (7, 13, 4), (10, 16, 4), (11, 20, 4), (12, 17, 4), (12, 18, 4), (13, 15, 4), (13, 20, 4), (16, 22, 4), (19, 22, 4), (20, 23, 4)].
