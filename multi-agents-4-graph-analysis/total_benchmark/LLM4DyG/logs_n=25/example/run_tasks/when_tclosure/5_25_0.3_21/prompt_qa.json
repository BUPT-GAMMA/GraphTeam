    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 5, 0), (0, 11, 0), (0, 14, 0), (0, 16, 0), (1, 8, 0), (1, 19, 0), (3, 7, 0), (4, 10, 0), (4, 18, 0), (4, 19, 0), (4, 23, 0), (5, 10, 0), (6, 9, 0), (6, 24, 0), (7, 9, 0), (8, 15, 0), (9, 13, 0), (9, 22, 0), (11, 14, 0), (11, 22, 0), (13, 23, 0), (15, 22, 0), (16, 23, 0), (18, 20, 0), (23, 24, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 3, 1), (1, 15, 1), (3, 8, 1), (5, 15, 1), (6, 23, 1), (7, 16, 1), (8, 13, 1), (10, 14, 1), (10, 16, 1), (10, 21, 1), (12, 15, 1), (14, 17, 1), (17, 22, 1), (18, 19, 1), (19, 21, 1), (20, 22, 1), (21, 22, 1), (0, 23, 2), (1, 6, 2), (1, 17, 2), (3, 14, 2), (3, 15, 2), (4, 13, 2), (4, 20, 2), (6, 12, 2), (6, 21, 2), (8, 17, 2), (8, 20, 2), (8, 24, 2), (10, 15, 2), (11, 15, 2), (11, 17, 2), (15, 18, 2), (16, 19, 2), (16, 21, 2), (0, 17, 3), (2, 16, 3), (4, 22, 3), (5, 14, 3), (7, 12, 3), (7, 17, 3), (13, 16, 3), (14, 24, 3), (17, 23, 3), (18, 22, 3), (19, 23, 3), (20, 23, 3), (0, 10, 4), (0, 18, 4), (1, 14, 4), (2, 4, 4), (2, 7, 4), (2, 17, 4), (2, 24, 4), (4, 12, 4), (6, 7, 4), (6, 17, 4), (6, 22, 4), (7, 18, 4), (7, 22, 4), (8, 11, 4), (14, 19, 4), (16, 17, 4)].
