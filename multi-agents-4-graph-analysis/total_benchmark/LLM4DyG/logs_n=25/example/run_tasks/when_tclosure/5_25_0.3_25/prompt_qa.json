    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 20, 0), (1, 14, 0), (2, 5, 0), (2, 14, 0), (2, 24, 0), (4, 22, 0), (5, 7, 0), (5, 20, 0), (8, 12, 0), (9, 13, 0), (10, 17, 0), (10, 19, 0), (12, 16, 0), (14, 17, 0), (14, 20, 0), (14, 21, 0), (14, 24, 0), (15, 18, 0), (18, 22, 0), (19, 20, 0), (20, 22, 0), (1, 6, 1), (1, 9, 1), (2, 4, 1), (2, 11, 1), (2, 21, 1), (4, 5, 1), (4, 9, 1), (5, 15, 1), (5, 17, 1), (6, 22, 1), (9, 24, 1), (11, 19, 1), (13, 17, 1), (14, 15, 1), (16, 24, 1), (0, 7, 2), (0, 13, 2), (2, 16, 2), (3, 15, 2), (3, 23, 2), (4, 11, 2), (4, 20, 2), (5, 12, 2), (5, 24, 2), (6, 9, 2), (6, 18, 2), (7, 11, 2), (7, 12, 2), (7, 16, 2), (8, 21, 2), (11, 17, 2), (12, 22, 2), (13, 20, 2), (20, 21, 2), (1, 12, 3), (1, 15, 3), (1, 24, 3), (4, 6, 3), (4, 23, 3), (5, 22, 3), (6, 7, 3), (6, 13, 3), (7, 10, 3), (7, 13, 3), (8, 15, 3), (8, 19, 3), (9, 18, 3), (10, 12, 3), (10, 16, 3), (10, 24, 3), (11, 14, 3), (11, 15, 3), (12, 21, 3), (12, 24, 3), (13, 15, 3), (13, 22, 3), (14, 22, 3), (0, 4, 4), (0, 9, 4), (0, 23, 4), (1, 3, 4), (1, 7, 4), (1, 17, 4), (2, 15, 4), (2, 20, 4), (3, 22, 4), (4, 13, 4), (4, 16, 4), (5, 11, 4), (6, 12, 4), (8, 9, 4), (8, 22, 4), (9, 10, 4), (10, 20, 4), (12, 20, 4), (16, 19, 4), (17, 23, 4), (18, 21, 4), (21, 22, 4)].
