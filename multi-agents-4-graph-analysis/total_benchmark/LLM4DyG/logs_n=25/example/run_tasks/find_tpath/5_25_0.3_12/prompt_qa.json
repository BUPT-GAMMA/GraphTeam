    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 24, 0), (1, 16, 0), (1, 23, 0), (3, 8, 0), (3, 14, 0), (4, 6, 0), (4, 9, 0), (5, 6, 0), (5, 12, 0), (5, 18, 0), (9, 11, 0), (14, 17, 0), (17, 20, 0), (19, 24, 0), (0, 7, 1), (1, 2, 1), (1, 8, 1), (2, 16, 1), (3, 7, 1), (4, 5, 1), (4, 16, 1), (5, 9, 1), (5, 10, 1), (5, 22, 1), (11, 23, 1), (12, 16, 1), (13, 19, 1), (15, 21, 1), (0, 13, 2), (1, 10, 2), (1, 15, 2), (2, 11, 2), (3, 11, 2), (3, 13, 2), (9, 14, 2), (9, 19, 2), (9, 22, 2), (10, 12, 2), (15, 18, 2), (16, 17, 2), (16, 21, 2), (16, 23, 2), (0, 4, 3), (0, 5, 3), (0, 15, 3), (0, 17, 3), (1, 13, 3), (2, 20, 3), (3, 5, 3), (3, 22, 3), (4, 10, 3), (4, 11, 3), (4, 21, 3), (6, 7, 3), (7, 16, 3), (7, 23, 3), (8, 15, 3), (8, 16, 3), (9, 17, 3), (10, 16, 3), (11, 22, 3), (12, 14, 3), (14, 15, 3), (14, 16, 3), (14, 20, 3), (16, 18, 3), (16, 19, 3), (0, 19, 4), (1, 5, 4), (2, 10, 4), (2, 24, 4), (3, 19, 4), (5, 17, 4), (5, 19, 4), (6, 24, 4), (8, 11, 4), (8, 23, 4), (9, 20, 4), (10, 20, 4), (12, 13, 4), (12, 23, 4), (15, 23, 4), (16, 22, 4)].
