    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 10, 0), (1, 13, 0), (1, 15, 0), (2, 8, 0), (2, 18, 0), (2, 23, 0), (6, 22, 0), (7, 16, 0), (8, 24, 0), (9, 15, 0), (9, 17, 0), (9, 20, 0), (9, 23, 0), (11, 22, 0), (15, 17, 0), (20, 22, 0), (2, 15, 1), (3, 8, 1), (4, 15, 1), (4, 19, 1), (5, 21, 1), (8, 16, 1), (9, 19, 1), (10, 22, 1), (12, 18, 1), (12, 20, 1), (13, 20, 1), (13, 24, 1), (14, 16, 1), (14, 17, 1), (17, 20, 1), (17, 24, 1), (0, 21, 2), (1, 8, 2), (1, 21, 2), (2, 13, 2), (2, 20, 2), (3, 13, 2), (3, 16, 2), (4, 13, 2), (4, 17, 2), (5, 12, 2), (6, 14, 2), (8, 13, 2), (8, 17, 2), (9, 10, 2), (10, 19, 2), (11, 15, 2), (12, 15, 2), (13, 15, 2), (16, 18, 2), (0, 2, 3), (0, 13, 3), (0, 22, 3), (1, 6, 3), (1, 17, 3), (2, 21, 3), (3, 14, 3), (3, 20, 3), (4, 10, 3), (4, 16, 3), (5, 18, 3), (5, 22, 3), (6, 8, 3), (7, 13, 3), (7, 17, 3), (7, 19, 3), (17, 22, 3), (18, 21, 3), (18, 23, 3), (19, 21, 3), (20, 23, 3), (0, 10, 4), (0, 20, 4), (2, 5, 4), (2, 10, 4), (3, 7, 4), (3, 22, 4), (5, 20, 4), (6, 10, 4), (6, 15, 4), (6, 17, 4), (6, 20, 4), (7, 8, 4), (8, 21, 4), (8, 23, 4), (10, 11, 4), (11, 20, 4), (11, 23, 4), (12, 16, 4), (12, 19, 4), (13, 14, 4), (13, 17, 4), (14, 19, 4), (21, 22, 4), (22, 24, 4)].
