    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 9, 0), (1, 16, 0), (3, 12, 0), (3, 23, 0), (4, 23, 0), (7, 17, 0), (8, 16, 0), (8, 23, 0), (9, 10, 0), (11, 12, 0), (15, 24, 0), (17, 18, 0), (18, 20, 0), (19, 21, 0), (0, 4, 1), (0, 8, 1), (1, 3, 1), (1, 8, 1), (1, 12, 1), (2, 21, 1), (2, 22, 1), (3, 5, 1), (3, 9, 1), (3, 22, 1), (4, 18, 1), (4, 22, 1), (7, 18, 1), (8, 13, 1), (8, 21, 1), (11, 19, 1), (11, 21, 1), (13, 15, 1), (13, 24, 1), (14, 16, 1), (17, 22, 1), (21, 22, 1), (1, 18, 2), (2, 3, 2), (3, 20, 2), (4, 10, 2), (4, 17, 2), (5, 17, 2), (7, 11, 2), (7, 21, 2), (8, 10, 2), (9, 23, 2), (13, 17, 2), (16, 21, 2), (16, 22, 2), (17, 20, 2), (20, 21, 2), (2, 8, 3), (2, 10, 3), (2, 14, 3), (3, 24, 3), (4, 12, 3), (4, 24, 3), (5, 15, 3), (5, 19, 3), (6, 19, 3), (7, 12, 3), (10, 16, 3), (10, 17, 3), (10, 20, 3), (10, 22, 3), (12, 17, 3), (13, 16, 3), (13, 18, 3), (13, 19, 3), (15, 17, 3), (15, 18, 3), (16, 17, 3), (0, 12, 4), (0, 19, 4), (0, 22, 4), (3, 21, 4), (4, 20, 4), (9, 16, 4), (9, 21, 4), (10, 13, 4), (10, 15, 4), (11, 13, 4), (13, 14, 4), (19, 20, 4)].
