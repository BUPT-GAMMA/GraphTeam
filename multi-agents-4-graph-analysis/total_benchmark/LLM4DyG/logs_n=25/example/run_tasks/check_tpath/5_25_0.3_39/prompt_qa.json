    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 9, 0), (0, 20, 0), (1, 17, 0), (2, 7, 0), (3, 11, 0), (3, 13, 0), (3, 15, 0), (3, 24, 0), (4, 7, 0), (4, 15, 0), (4, 19, 0), (4, 22, 0), (4, 23, 0), (5, 10, 0), (5, 18, 0), (6, 19, 0), (10, 23, 0), (11, 19, 0), (11, 21, 0), (12, 15, 0), (12, 19, 0), (13, 18, 0), (13, 19, 0), (14, 23, 0), (15, 23, 0), (17, 18, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 3, 1), (0, 7, 1), (1, 20, 1), (2, 6, 1), (3, 5, 1), (3, 17, 1), (3, 21, 1), (3, 22, 1), (4, 14, 1), (5, 8, 1), (5, 22, 1), (6, 17, 1), (6, 22, 1), (7, 11, 1), (7, 17, 1), (7, 19, 1), (7, 24, 1), (8, 12, 1), (11, 17, 1), (11, 20, 1), (14, 19, 1), (14, 20, 1), (16, 18, 1), (16, 19, 1), (16, 20, 1), (18, 22, 1), (19, 21, 1), (3, 20, 2), (6, 21, 2), (7, 15, 2), (7, 22, 2), (8, 13, 2), (8, 18, 2), (8, 21, 2), (9, 10, 2), (9, 14, 2), (11, 12, 2), (14, 24, 2), (19, 20, 2), (19, 22, 2), (0, 13, 3), (0, 14, 3), (1, 2, 3), (1, 4, 3), (2, 23, 3), (4, 8, 3), (6, 11, 3), (6, 14, 3), (6, 16, 3), (9, 13, 3), (10, 15, 3), (11, 13, 3), (14, 16, 3), (16, 22, 3), (17, 24, 3), (19, 24, 3), (21, 24, 3), (0, 11, 4), (0, 23, 4), (1, 5, 4), (1, 15, 4), (1, 23, 4), (2, 10, 4), (2, 14, 4), (2, 18, 4), (3, 6, 4), (3, 23, 4), (5, 7, 4), (8, 10, 4), (8, 11, 4), (8, 14, 4), (9, 19, 4), (9, 24, 4), (10, 18, 4), (13, 20, 4), (14, 21, 4), (15, 19, 4), (15, 21, 4), (17, 23, 4)].
