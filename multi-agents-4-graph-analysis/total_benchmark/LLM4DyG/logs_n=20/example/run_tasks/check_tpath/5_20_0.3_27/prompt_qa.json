    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 5, 0), (0, 10, 0), (0, 13, 0), (0, 16, 0), (1, 4, 0), (3, 16, 0), (5, 14, 0), (6, 11, 0), (7, 15, 0), (8, 17, 0), (9, 12, 0), (10, 18, 0), (12, 18, 0), (1, 7, 1), (1, 13, 1), (2, 7, 1), (3, 4, 1), (5, 15, 1), (8, 12, 1), (8, 15, 1), (10, 12, 1), (13, 18, 1), (2, 3, 2), (2, 5, 2), (2, 9, 2), (3, 15, 2), (4, 15, 2), (4, 19, 2), (6, 9, 2), (6, 18, 2), (15, 19, 2), (17, 19, 2), (0, 4, 3), (3, 11, 3), (3, 13, 3), (3, 19, 3), (4, 14, 3), (5, 9, 3), (6, 12, 3), (6, 15, 3), (7, 13, 3), (11, 19, 3), (3, 8, 4), (4, 9, 4), (4, 17, 4), (8, 9, 4), (8, 19, 4), (9, 19, 4), (11, 12, 4), (12, 16, 4)]. Is the path [18, 13, 1] a chronological path?\n",
