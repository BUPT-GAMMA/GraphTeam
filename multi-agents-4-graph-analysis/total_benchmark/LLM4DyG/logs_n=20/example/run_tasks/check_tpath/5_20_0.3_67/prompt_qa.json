    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 5, 0), (2, 16, 0), (6, 14, 0), (8, 16, 0), (9, 13, 0), (10, 18, 0), (0, 10, 1), (0, 11, 1), (0, 15, 1), (1, 15, 1), (3, 13, 1), (5, 16, 1), (7, 10, 1), (13, 14, 1), (13, 19, 1), (15, 17, 1), (0, 9, 2), (1, 19, 2), (2, 5, 2), (2, 12, 2), (3, 7, 2), (4, 15, 2), (5, 14, 2), (7, 11, 2), (7, 14, 2), (8, 17, 2), (9, 10, 2), (10, 14, 2), (12, 14, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 12, 3), (0, 14, 3), (0, 19, 3), (1, 6, 3), (2, 15, 3), (4, 12, 3), (4, 16, 3), (7, 8, 3), (9, 17, 3), (10, 15, 3), (11, 13, 3), (12, 16, 3), (16, 18, 3), (16, 19, 3), (1, 8, 4), (5, 8, 4), (5, 17, 4), (7, 12, 4), (7, 15, 4), (9, 19, 4), (11, 19, 4), (12, 15, 4)]. Is the path [9, 17, 5] a chronological path?\n",
