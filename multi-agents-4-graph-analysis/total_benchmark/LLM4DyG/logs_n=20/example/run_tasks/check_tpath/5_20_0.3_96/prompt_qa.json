    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(4, 16, 0), (5, 13, 0), (5, 18, 0), (6, 19, 0), (9, 16, 0), (10, 13, 0), (11, 17, 0), (12, 16, 0), (0, 15, 1), (1, 8, 1), (2, 4, 1), (3, 9, 1), (4, 8, 1), (4, 9, 1), (5, 19, 1), (6, 9, 1), (7, 15, 1), (9, 10, 1), (11, 13, 1), (13, 15, 1), (0, 8, 2), (1, 9, 2), (2, 6, 2), (3, 6, 2), (3, 10, 2), (4, 10, 2), (4, 12, 2), (6, 15, 2), (6, 16, 2), (7, 10, 2), (8, 10, 2), (8, 18, 2), (12, 14, 2), (12, 15, 2), (1, 15, 3), (3, 13, 3), (8, 13, 3), (9, 18, 3), (10, 12, 3), (10, 14, 3), (10, 18, 3), (12, 18, 3), (0, 4, 4), (0, 11, 4), (0, 13, 4), (2, 9, 4), (2, 18, 4), (3, 15, 4), (4, 11, 4), (4, 18, 4), (5, 6, 4), (6, 17, 4), (7, 8, 4), (8, 15, 4), (10, 15, 4), (15, 18, 4)]. Is the path [12, 17, 3] a chronological path?\n",
