    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 11, 0), (1, 10, 0), (1, 11, 0), (2, 17, 0), (3, 15, 0), (3, 18, 0), (4, 9, 0), (6, 15, 0), (9, 15, 0), (10, 16, 0), (14, 15, 0), (1, 2, 1), (2, 9, 1), (3, 5, 1), (3, 10, 1), (3, 11, 1), (4, 16, 1), (5, 6, 1), (6, 9, 1), (6, 16, 1), (9, 11, 1), (11, 14, 1), (11, 16, 1), (13, 15, 1), (14, 16, 1), (0, 9, 2), (0, 14, 2), (1, 4, 2), (4, 7, 2), (4, 15, 2), (4, 17, 2), (5, 16, 2), (6, 10, 2), (7, 15, 2), (9, 13, 2), (10, 13, 2), (10, 14, 2), (12, 13, 2), (13, 17, 2), (18, 19, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 6, 3), (1, 8, 3), (3, 8, 3), (4, 10, 3), (7, 19, 3), (8, 14, 3), (10, 15, 3), (11, 12, 3), (0, 4, 4), (0, 15, 4), (1, 12, 4), (5, 9, 4), (5, 10, 4), (5, 17, 4), (6, 7, 4), (7, 11, 4), (7, 18, 4), (13, 16, 4), (14, 17, 4), (17, 18, 4), (17, 19, 4)]. Is the path [18, 19, 7] a chronological path?\n",
