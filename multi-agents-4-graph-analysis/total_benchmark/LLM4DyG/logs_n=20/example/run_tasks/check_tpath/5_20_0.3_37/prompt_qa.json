    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 15, 0), (1, 18, 0), (2, 3, 0), (2, 18, 0), (3, 12, 0), (3, 17, 0), (9, 19, 0), (11, 13, 0), (14, 19, 0), (16, 18, 0), (17, 18, 0), (3, 9, 1), (4, 8, 1), (6, 8, 1), (6, 12, 1), (8, 10, 1), (13, 16, 1), (18, 19, 1), (1, 3, 2), (1, 13, 2), (2, 9, 2), (3, 7, 2), (3, 14, 2), (4, 13, 2), (4, 16, 2), (5, 19, 2), (6, 10, 2), (7, 12, 2), (9, 11, 2), (12, 19, 2), (13, 17, 2), (15, 16, 2), (0, 2, 3), (0, 13, 3), (1, 4, 3), (1, 11, 3), (2, 5, 3), (3, 15, 3), (4, 14, 3), (5, 6, 3), (5, 16, 3), (6, 9, 3), (7, 18, 3), (8, 11, 3), (8, 15, 3), (10, 18, 3), (11, 14, 3), (11, 16, 3), (0, 10, 4), (1, 2, 4), (2, 15, 4), (3, 4, 4), (4, 7, 4), (5, 8, 4), (8, 9, 4), (8, 17, 4), (9, 12, 4), (9, 14, 4), (9, 17, 4), (10, 13, 4), (14, 16, 4), (14, 18, 4)]. Is the path [13, 4, 3] a chronological path?\n",
