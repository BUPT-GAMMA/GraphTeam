    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 2, 0), (1, 3, 0), (1, 17, 0), (2, 6, 0), (4, 10, 0), (5, 18, 0), (6, 8, 0), (6, 12, 0), (8, 10, 0), (14, 19, 0), (0, 13, 1), (1, 5, 1), (1, 6, 1), (1, 10, 1), (2, 8, 1), (3, 4, 1), (3, 10, 1), (4, 15, 1), (6, 15, 1), (9, 10, 1), (9, 15, 1), (9, 17, 1), (10, 14, 1), (0, 2, 2), (2, 16, 2), (3, 7, 2), (3, 17, 2), (5, 16, 2), (7, 17, 2), (8, 9, 2), (8, 13, 2), (2, 10, 3), (3, 12, 3), (5, 19, 3), (6, 7, 3), (6, 11, 3), (6, 17, 3), (7, 9, 3), (7, 11, 3), (8, 16, 3), (8, 19, 3), (10, 17, 3), (11, 17, 3), (15, 19, 3), (17, 19, 3), (1, 11, 4), (1, 12, 4), (1, 13, 4), (1, 16, 4), (3, 8, 4), (5, 9, 4), (6, 18, 4), (7, 16, 4), (9, 11, 4), (11, 15, 4), (11, 16, 4), (11, 19, 4), (13, 18, 4), (13, 19, 4)]. Is the path [18, 0, 5] a chronological path?\n",
