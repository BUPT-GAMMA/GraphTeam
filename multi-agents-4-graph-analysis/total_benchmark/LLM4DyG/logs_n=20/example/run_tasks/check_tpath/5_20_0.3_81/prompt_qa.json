    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 14, 0), (2, 17, 0), (3, 13, 0), (8, 9, 0), (13, 16, 0), (14, 16, 0), (0, 11, 1), (1, 9, 1), (2, 3, 1), (2, 7, 1), (2, 11, 1), (3, 10, 1), (4, 17, 1), (5, 18, 1), (7, 14, 1), (9, 10, 1), (9, 15, 1), (10, 18, 1), (11, 13, 1), (12, 16, 1), (13, 14, 1), (16, 17, 1), (17, 18, 1), (2, 4, 2), (2, 19, 2), (3, 6, 2), (5, 7, 2), (12, 13, 2), (15, 16, 2), (16, 19, 2), (0, 6, 3), (0, 15, 3), (0, 17, 3), (1, 7, 3), (2, 10, 3), (2, 13, 3), (3, 17, 3), (3, 18, 3), (5, 16, 3), (6, 11, 3), (6, 16, 3), (6, 18, 3), (7, 9, 3), (7, 15, 3), (9, 11, 3), (9, 17, 3), (13, 18, 3), (15, 19, 3), (16, 18, 3), (2, 12, 4), (3, 9, 4), (4, 9, 4), (5, 15, 4), (6, 8, 4), (6, 10, 4), (8, 14, 4), (8, 18, 4), (10, 15, 4), (12, 19, 4), (14, 19, 4)]. Is the path [0, 14, 16] a chronological path?\n",
