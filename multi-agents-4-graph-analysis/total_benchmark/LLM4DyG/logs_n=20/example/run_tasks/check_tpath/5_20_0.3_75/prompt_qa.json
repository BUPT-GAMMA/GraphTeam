    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 3, 0), (0, 14, 0), (1, 3, 0), (1, 8, 0), (1, 19, 0), (3, 4, 0), (3, 8, 0), (3, 9, 0), (4, 6, 0), (9, 19, 0), (11, 14, 0), (12, 14, 0), (12, 15, 0), (13, 19, 0), (15, 16, 0), (1, 2, 1), (1, 17, 1), (2, 9, 1), (6, 12, 1), (6, 17, 1), (9, 10, 1), (10, 14, 1), (10, 16, 1), (12, 17, 1), (13, 15, 1), (13, 16, 1), (15, 18, 1), (17, 19, 1), (1, 12, 2), (1, 16, 2), (2, 11, 2), (6, 11, 2), (7, 10, 2), (7, 16, 2), (8, 16, 2), (10, 19, 2), (17, 18, 2), (0, 15, 3), (2, 4, 3), (2, 7, 3), (6, 15, 3), (7, 11, 3), (9, 12, 3), (10, 12, 3), (14, 18, 3), (18, 19, 3), (2, 12, 4), (2, 19, 4), (3, 11, 4), (3, 12, 4), (4, 18, 4), (5, 11, 4), (10, 13, 4), (14, 15, 4), (14, 16, 4), (15, 19, 4)]. Is the path [9, 10, 19] a chronological path?\n",
