    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 3, 0), (1, 14, 0), (3, 8, 0), (3, 14, 0), (6, 17, 0), (9, 10, 0), (9, 16, 0), (10, 16, 0), (0, 18, 1), (2, 14, 1), (4, 6, 1), (6, 18, 1), (8, 19, 1), (9, 17, 1), (12, 17, 1), (15, 17, 1), (0, 1, 2), (0, 7, 2), (1, 4, 2), (1, 18, 2), (2, 12, 2), (6, 16, 2), (8, 9, 2), (8, 11, 2), (9, 11, 2), (11, 12, 2), (11, 15, 2), (11, 19, 2), (12, 15, 2), (13, 16, 2), (13, 17, 2), (13, 18, 2), (14, 17, 2), (15, 16, 2), (1, 19, 3), (2, 13, 3), (3, 11, 3), (4, 15, 3), (7, 14, 3), (8, 18, 3), (10, 13, 3), (10, 15, 3), (10, 19, 3), (11, 18, 3), (15, 18, 3), (17, 19, 3), (0, 6, 4), (0, 9, 4), (0, 17, 4), (1, 11, 4), (1, 13, 4), (2, 17, 4), (3, 7, 4), (4, 16, 4), (4, 19, 4), (5, 12, 4), (5, 18, 4), (7, 15, 4), (7, 16, 4), (10, 11, 4), (13, 15, 4), (14, 19, 4)]. Is the path [1, 18, 5] a chronological path?\n",
