    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 6, 0), (1, 11, 0), (2, 5, 0), (5, 9, 0), (6, 7, 0), (7, 8, 0), (10, 15, 0), (10, 18, 0), (11, 17, 0), (13, 16, 0), (14, 16, 0), (0, 1, 1), (1, 2, 1), (1, 17, 1), (2, 12, 1), (3, 5, 1), (4, 12, 1), (5, 11, 1), (6, 13, 1), (6, 18, 1), (7, 12, 1), (8, 17, 1), (9, 10, 1), (10, 17, 1), (12, 15, 1), (18, 19, 1), (3, 4, 2), (3, 16, 2), (4, 5, 2), (4, 8, 2), (4, 19, 2), (5, 18, 2), (6, 19, 2), (7, 11, 2), (7, 14, 2), (13, 15, 2), (0, 8, 3), (1, 10, 3), (1, 15, 3), (3, 7, 3), (6, 17, 3), (7, 13, 3), (8, 14, 3), (11, 19, 3), (12, 18, 3), (12, 19, 3), (16, 18, 3), (17, 18, 3), (0, 4, 4), (2, 19, 4), (4, 10, 4), (6, 9, 4), (6, 11, 4), (7, 10, 4), (8, 9, 4), (8, 19, 4), (9, 13, 4), (11, 12, 4), (11, 14, 4), (14, 18, 4), (17, 19, 4)]. Is the path [15, 13, 9] a chronological path?\n",
