    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 8, 0), (0, 11, 0), (2, 11, 0), (3, 4, 0), (8, 15, 0), (8, 17, 0), (9, 12, 0), (9, 19, 0), (12, 15, 0), (12, 17, 0), (0, 9, 1), (1, 14, 1), (2, 8, 1), (3, 5, 1), (3, 14, 1), (3, 18, 1), (4, 18, 1), (5, 7, 1), (7, 8, 1), (13, 18, 1), (1, 2, 2), (2, 9, 2), (3, 9, 2), (6, 14, 2), (7, 13, 2), (7, 15, 2), (10, 12, 2), (12, 18, 2), (12, 19, 2), (15, 18, 2), (16, 17, 2), (0, 4, 3), (0, 14, 3), (2, 3, 3), (2, 4, 3), (2, 10, 3), (3, 16, 3), (4, 15, 3), (5, 10, 3), (5, 13, 3), (8, 12, 3), (12, 16, 3), (13, 16, 3), (14, 19, 3), (16, 19, 3), (0, 13, 4), (2, 7, 4), (2, 16, 4), (4, 16, 4), (5, 8, 4), (6, 13, 4), (7, 18, 4), (8, 19, 4), (10, 19, 4), (14, 17, 4), (17, 19, 4)]. Is the path [1, 14, 3] a chronological path?\n",
