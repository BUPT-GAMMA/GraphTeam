    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 2, 0), (0, 9, 0), (0, 17, 0), (1, 6, 0), (4, 7, 0), (4, 8, 0), (4, 18, 0), (5, 10, 0), (9, 12, 0), (9, 17, 0), (10, 13, 0), (0, 11, 1), (0, 16, 1), (2, 3, 1), (2, 11, 1), (3, 18, 1), (5, 17, 1), (6, 19, 1), (14, 15, 1), (17, 18, 1), (0, 12, 2), (1, 4, 2), (1, 13, 2), (2, 10, 2), (2, 15, 2), (6, 7, 2), (10, 15, 2), (11, 13, 2), (15, 18, 2), (16, 19, 2), (2, 7, 3), (3, 16, 3), (4, 12, 3), (5, 15, 3), (6, 9, 3), (6, 11, 3), (6, 14, 3), (8, 12, 3), (11, 12, 3), (12, 17, 3), (0, 13, 4), (1, 2, 4), (2, 8, 4), (4, 10, 4), (7, 9, 4), (8, 19, 4), (9, 11, 4), (9, 13, 4), (10, 11, 4), (11, 18, 4)]. Is the path [7, 18, 16] a chronological path?\n",
