    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 6, 0), (2, 4, 0), (2, 11, 0), (4, 8, 0), (4, 14, 0), (5, 12, 0), (5, 15, 0), (6, 18, 0), (7, 12, 0), (7, 18, 0), (15, 17, 0), (0, 7, 1), (1, 7, 1), (1, 13, 1), (3, 10, 1), (4, 7, 1), (5, 11, 1), (6, 9, 1), (7, 9, 1), (7, 10, 1), (8, 11, 1), (0, 13, 2), (1, 15, 2), (2, 3, 2), (3, 5, 2), (4, 11, 2), (4, 13, 2), (16, 17, 2), (18, 19, 2), (0, 4, 3), (0, 5, 3), (0, 15, 3), (0, 17, 3), (1, 18, 3), (3, 14, 3), (4, 5, 3), (5, 8, 3), (5, 16, 3), (5, 17, 3), (6, 14, 3), (8, 14, 3), (11, 13, 3), (12, 13, 3), (13, 15, 3), (13, 16, 3), (17, 18, 3), (0, 19, 4), (1, 10, 4), (3, 4, 4), (3, 18, 4), (4, 19, 4), (7, 17, 4), (7, 19, 4), (10, 12, 4), (12, 17, 4), (14, 18, 4)]. Is the path [16, 15, 3] a chronological path?\n",
