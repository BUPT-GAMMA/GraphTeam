    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 3, 0), (1, 17, 0), (2, 12, 0), (7, 17, 0), (8, 17, 0), (9, 18, 0), (13, 14, 0), (16, 17, 0), (18, 19, 0), (1, 14, 1), (2, 19, 1), (3, 12, 1), (3, 14, 1), (3, 16, 1), (3, 17, 1), (5, 19, 1), (6, 11, 1), (6, 19, 1), (8, 10, 1), (8, 13, 1), (10, 15, 1), (17, 19, 1), (0, 1, 2), (1, 12, 2), (5, 7, 2), (5, 11, 2), (6, 10, 2), (6, 13, 2), (10, 18, 2), (10, 19, 2), (13, 18, 2), (14, 19, 2), (17, 18, 2), (0, 13, 3), (1, 8, 3), (2, 5, 3), (2, 6, 3), (2, 11, 3), (4, 7, 3), (6, 9, 3), (7, 8, 3), (8, 12, 3), (9, 13, 3), (9, 15, 3), (11, 12, 3), (0, 5, 4), (0, 18, 4), (2, 17, 4), (3, 19, 4), (4, 15, 4), (5, 16, 4), (6, 8, 4), (7, 14, 4), (7, 18, 4), (8, 15, 4), (9, 11, 4), (10, 16, 4), (14, 17, 4)]. Is the path [14, 1, 8] a chronological path?\n",
