    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 19, 0), (1, 2, 0), (1, 4, 0), (1, 7, 0), (2, 9, 0), (5, 17, 0), (6, 10, 0), (6, 12, 0), (11, 12, 0), (11, 14, 0), (11, 19, 0), (12, 17, 0), (14, 16, 0), (0, 10, 1), (1, 11, 1), (2, 17, 1), (8, 13, 1), (8, 15, 1), (8, 18, 1), (9, 12, 1), (10, 16, 1), (11, 13, 1), (1, 3, 2), (1, 6, 2), (1, 19, 2), (2, 14, 2), (3, 12, 2), (3, 14, 2), (3, 17, 2), (7, 19, 2), (8, 16, 2), (8, 19, 2), (9, 18, 2), (15, 16, 2), (0, 17, 3), (2, 5, 3), (3, 10, 3), (3, 16, 3), (4, 11, 3), (4, 19, 3), (5, 8, 3), (5, 11, 3), (7, 12, 3), (8, 14, 3), (17, 19, 3), (0, 5, 4), (0, 13, 4), (1, 18, 4), (2, 4, 4), (2, 6, 4), (3, 5, 4), (3, 6, 4), (3, 13, 4), (6, 11, 4), (7, 9, 4), (7, 18, 4), (10, 15, 4), (10, 17, 4), (11, 15, 4), (12, 15, 4), (15, 18, 4)]. Is the path [17, 12, 18] a chronological path?\n",
