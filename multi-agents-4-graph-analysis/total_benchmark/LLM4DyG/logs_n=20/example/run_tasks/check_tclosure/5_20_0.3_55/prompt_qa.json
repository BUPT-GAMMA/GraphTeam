    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether three nodes in the dynamic graph formed a closed triad. A closed triad is composed of three nodes which have linked with each other some time. \nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 3, 0), (1, 7, 0), (1, 16, 0), (2, 6, 0), (3, 5, 0), (3, 17, 0), (3, 18, 0), (4, 12, 0), (6, 12, 0), (9, 13, 0), (10, 11, 0), (11, 12, 0), (11, 19, 0), (13, 17, 0), (1, 3, 1), (2, 3, 1), (3, 14, 1), (6, 9, 1), (7, 16, 1), (8, 13, 1), (15, 17, 1), (0, 1, 2), (2, 15, 2), (3, 13, 2), (4, 14, 2), (7, 19, 2), (9, 16, 2), (10, 15, 2), (11, 14, 2), (12, 19, 2), (13, 19, 2), (15, 16, 2), (1, 2, 3), (1, 8, 3), (2, 10, 3), (2, 18, 3), (3, 6, 3), (3, 7, 3), (5, 8, 3), (5, 14, 3), (10, 12, 3), (13, 16, 3), (16, 18, 3), (1, 11, 4), (5, 6, 4), (5, 18, 4), (6, 10, 4), (6, 15, 4), (6, 19, 4), (7, 10, 4), (12, 15, 4), (17, 19, 4)].
