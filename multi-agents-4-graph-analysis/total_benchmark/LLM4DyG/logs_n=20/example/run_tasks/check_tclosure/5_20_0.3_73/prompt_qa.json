    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether three nodes in the dynamic graph formed a closed triad. A closed triad is composed of three nodes which have linked with each other some time. \nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 9, 0), (0, 10, 0), (2, 14, 0), (5, 19, 0), (6, 9, 0), (6, 15, 0), (6, 19, 0), (8, 11, 0), (11, 14, 0), (14, 15, 0), (14, 16, 0), (14, 18, 0), (1, 2, 1), (1, 10, 1), (1, 16, 1), (2, 12, 1), (3, 4, 1), (3, 14, 1), (4, 9, 1), (5, 10, 1), (5, 16, 1), (8, 13, 1), (13, 15, 1), (16, 18, 1), (17, 18, 1), (0, 1, 2), (0, 8, 2), (1, 9, 2), (1, 19, 2), (4, 10, 2), (5, 8, 2), (8, 10, 2), (9, 18, 2), (12, 19, 2), (15, 17, 2), (15, 18, 2), (0, 12, 3), (1, 14, 3), (1, 17, 3), (2, 7, 3), (2, 18, 3), (3, 8, 3), (4, 13, 3), (5, 11, 3), (6, 12, 3), (7, 9, 3), (8, 19, 3), (11, 13, 3), (12, 15, 3), (12, 16, 3), (16, 19, 3), (18, 19, 3), (1, 12, 4), (1, 13, 4), (2, 4, 4), (2, 6, 4), (3, 18, 4), (4, 8, 4), (4, 11, 4), (5, 12, 4), (6, 10, 4), (15, 19, 4)]. Did the three nodes [16, 5, 19] form a closed triad?\n",
