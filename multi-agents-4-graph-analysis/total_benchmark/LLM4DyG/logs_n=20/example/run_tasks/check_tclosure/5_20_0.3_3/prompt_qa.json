    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether three nodes in the dynamic graph formed a closed triad. A closed triad is composed of three nodes which have linked with each other some time. \nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 6, 0), (0, 10, 0), (0, 16, 0), (1, 4, 0), (3, 14, 0), (4, 6, 0), (7, 9, 0), (8, 11, 0), (8, 15, 0), (10, 14, 0), (12, 16, 0), (12, 19, 0), (14, 17, 0), (15, 19, 0), (0, 7, 1), (2, 5, 1), (3, 5, 1), (4, 10, 1), (5, 12, 1), (7, 12, 1), (10, 11, 1), (11, 15, 1), (13, 14, 1), (16, 17, 1), (0, 1, 2), (2, 3, 2), (3, 11, 2), (4, 7, 2), (4, 12, 2), (5, 6, 2), (5, 8, 2), (6, 16, 2), (7, 15, 2), (13, 19, 2), (0, 9, 3), (1, 8, 3), (2, 4, 3), (5, 13, 3), (8, 12, 3), (9, 16, 3), (10, 13, 3), (3, 15, 4), (3, 18, 4), (5, 9, 4), (10, 17, 4), (12, 13, 4), (12, 14, 4), (14, 15, 4)]. Did the three nodes [9, 7, 0] form a closed triad?\n",
