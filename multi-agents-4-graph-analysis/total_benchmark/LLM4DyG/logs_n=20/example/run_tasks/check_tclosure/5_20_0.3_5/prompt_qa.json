    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether three nodes in the dynamic graph formed a closed triad. A closed triad is composed of three nodes which have linked with each other some time. \nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 12, 0), (0, 17, 0), (1, 4, 0), (1, 6, 0), (1, 11, 0), (3, 18, 0), (4, 13, 0), (4, 17, 0), (0, 14, 1), (1, 9, 1), (2, 7, 1), (2, 11, 1), (2, 14, 1), (3, 9, 1), (3, 12, 1), (3, 16, 1), (5, 15, 1), (6, 16, 1), (7, 16, 1), (11, 14, 1), (17, 18, 1), (2, 10, 2), (3, 7, 2), (3, 17, 2), (4, 5, 2), (6, 7, 2), (7, 14, 2), (0, 7, 3), (0, 19, 3), (1, 12, 3), (1, 19, 3), (5, 16, 3), (5, 19, 3), (6, 18, 3), (7, 9, 3), (8, 18, 3), (9, 15, 3), (9, 16, 3), (11, 18, 3), (12, 13, 3), (15, 16, 3), (0, 18, 4), (1, 8, 4), (1, 15, 4), (2, 9, 4), (4, 19, 4), (5, 14, 4), (6, 11, 4), (7, 18, 4), (8, 16, 4), (10, 18, 4)]. Did the three nodes [7, 16, 6] form a closed triad?\n",
