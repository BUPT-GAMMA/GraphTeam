    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether three nodes in the dynamic graph formed a closed triad. A closed triad is composed of three nodes which have linked with each other some time. \nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 4, 0), (0, 7, 0), (2, 6, 0), (2, 15, 0), (3, 10, 0), (8, 10, 0), (10, 14, 0), (14, 17, 0), (14, 18, 0), (17, 19, 0), (0, 13, 1), (2, 4, 1), (2, 10, 1), (2, 12, 1), (4, 12, 1), (6, 17, 1), (8, 17, 1), (8, 19, 1), (10, 17, 1), (12, 17, 1), (12, 19, 1), (15, 19, 1), (16, 17, 1), (0, 11, 2), (1, 2, 2), (1, 8, 2), (3, 14, 2), (3, 16, 2), (4, 18, 2), (5, 9, 2), (5, 13, 2), (7, 15, 2), (7, 16, 2), (7, 18, 2), (11, 14, 2), (11, 19, 2), (14, 15, 2), (0, 3, 3), (1, 4, 3), (1, 13, 3), (1, 14, 3), (1, 15, 3), (3, 17, 3), (4, 8, 3), (4, 9, 3), (4, 15, 3), (5, 14, 3), (7, 8, 3), (7, 11, 3), (9, 12, 3), (9, 14, 3), (10, 19, 3), (13, 14, 3), (0, 18, 4), (3, 4, 4), (3, 8, 4), (3, 9, 4), (4, 16, 4), (6, 10, 4), (6, 13, 4), (7, 19, 4), (8, 18, 4), (13, 17, 4), (13, 18, 4), (16, 19, 4)]. Did the three nodes [9, 4, 14] form a closed triad?\n",
