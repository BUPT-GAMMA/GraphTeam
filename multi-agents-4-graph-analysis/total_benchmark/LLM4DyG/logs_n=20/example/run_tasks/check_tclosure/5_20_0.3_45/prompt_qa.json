    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether three nodes in the dynamic graph formed a closed triad. A closed triad is composed of three nodes which have linked with each other some time. \nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 6, 0), (0, 13, 0), (1, 5, 0), (1, 6, 0), (2, 10, 0), (3, 6, 0), (5, 7, 0), (5, 8, 0), (7, 17, 0), (8, 10, 0), (8, 19, 0), (11, 14, 0), (12, 16, 0), (0, 11, 1), (0, 16, 1), (0, 19, 1), (2, 16, 1), (3, 16, 1), (4, 5, 1), (5, 11, 1), (8, 9, 1), (9, 17, 1), (16, 18, 1), (1, 10, 2), (3, 10, 2), (4, 14, 2), (6, 17, 2), (10, 11, 2), (14, 15, 2), (14, 16, 2), (18, 19, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 3, 3), (0, 7, 3), (4, 17, 3), (6, 10, 3), (6, 14, 3), (10, 14, 3), (13, 14, 3), (0, 5, 4), (0, 8, 4), (1, 9, 4), (2, 5, 4), (2, 13, 4), (2, 18, 4), (3, 12, 4), (3, 14, 4), (4, 13, 4), (7, 19, 4), (14, 19, 4)]. Did the three nodes [0, 5, 11] form a closed triad?\n",
