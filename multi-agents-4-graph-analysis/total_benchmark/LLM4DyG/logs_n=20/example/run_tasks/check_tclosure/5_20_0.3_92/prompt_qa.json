    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether three nodes in the dynamic graph formed a closed triad. A closed triad is composed of three nodes which have linked with each other some time. \nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(2, 19, 0), (3, 10, 0), (8, 10, 0), (12, 18, 0), (2, 7, 1), (2, 14, 1), (5, 19, 1), (6, 15, 1), (7, 14, 1), (7, 17, 1), (8, 14, 1), (9, 10, 1), (9, 14, 1), (9, 16, 1), (10, 18, 1), (14, 15, 1), (0, 15, 2), (0, 19, 2), (1, 12, 2), (1, 18, 2), (1, 19, 2), (2, 5, 2), (3, 16, 2), (3, 19, 2), (5, 6, 2), (8, 19, 2), (11, 18, 2), (13, 17, 2), (1, 4, 3), (1, 14, 3), (3, 8, 3), (4, 16, 3), (5, 8, 3), (6, 14, 3), (14, 17, 3), (15, 17, 3), (15, 18, 3), (1, 17, 4), (2, 8, 4), (3, 18, 4), (6, 10, 4), (6, 17, 4), (7, 12, 4), (8, 18, 4), (9, 13, 4), (10, 16, 4), (11, 12, 4), (12, 15, 4), (13, 14, 4), (13, 16, 4), (16, 18, 4), (17, 19, 4)].
