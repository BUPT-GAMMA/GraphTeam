    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether three nodes in the dynamic graph formed a closed triad. A closed triad is composed of three nodes which have linked with each other some time. \nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 11, 0), (1, 11, 0), (2, 6, 0), (2, 9, 0), (2, 19, 0), (3, 11, 0), (3, 15, 0), (4, 19, 0), (10, 12, 0), (11, 17, 0), (13, 15, 0), (13, 16, 0), (0, 4, 1), (0, 14, 1), (1, 10, 1), (1, 12, 1), (2, 7, 1), (4, 13, 1), (5, 18, 1), (6, 12, 1), (6, 14, 1), (7, 17, 1), (8, 19, 1), (12, 14, 1), (14, 16, 1), (2, 3, 2), (2, 15, 2), (4, 9, 2), (9, 19, 2), (10, 15, 2), (12, 19, 2), (0, 18, 3), (3, 6, 3), (3, 14, 3), (3, 17, 3), (6, 9, 3), (6, 10, 3), (9, 16, 3), (10, 13, 3), (13, 17, 3), (15, 16, 3), (0, 8, 4), (1, 5, 4), (3, 5, 4), (3, 12, 4), (5, 10, 4), (6, 13, 4), (7, 16, 4), (9, 14, 4), (10, 14, 4)]. Did the three nodes [4, 7, 1] form a closed triad?\n",
