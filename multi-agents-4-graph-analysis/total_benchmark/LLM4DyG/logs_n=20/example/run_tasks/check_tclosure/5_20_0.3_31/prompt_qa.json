    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether three nodes in the dynamic graph formed a closed triad. A closed triad is composed of three nodes which have linked with each other some time. \nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 2, 0), (4, 13, 0), (4, 14, 0), (6, 9, 0), (8, 11, 0), (8, 19, 0), (10, 16, 0), (11, 15, 0), (14, 15, 0), (15, 19, 0), (1, 8, 1), (1, 14, 1), (2, 7, 1), (2, 10, 1), (5, 7, 1), (6, 13, 1), (6, 14, 1), (6, 16, 1), (6, 18, 1), (6, 19, 1), (7, 9, 1), (8, 17, 1), (9, 11, 1), (10, 15, 1), (13, 14, 1), (13, 19, 1), (0, 1, 2), (0, 5, 2), (0, 6, 2), (0, 17, 2), (0, 18, 2), (1, 3, 2), (1, 7, 2), (2, 9, 2), (3, 9, 2), (4, 11, 2), (5, 11, 2), (6, 12, 2), (9, 17, 2), (12, 14, 2), (13, 15, 2), (13, 17, 2), (1, 17, 3), (3, 14, 3), (3, 19, 3), (4, 10, 3), (5, 12, 3), (5, 18, 3), (10, 12, 3), (11, 14, 3), (12, 13, 3), (17, 19, 3), (0, 7, 4), (0, 9, 4), (0, 12, 4), (2, 4, 4), (3, 5, 4), (3, 10, 4), (5, 13, 4), (6, 11, 4), (7, 10, 4), (8, 10, 4), (12, 19, 4)]. Did the three nodes [15, 14, 13] form a closed triad?\n",
