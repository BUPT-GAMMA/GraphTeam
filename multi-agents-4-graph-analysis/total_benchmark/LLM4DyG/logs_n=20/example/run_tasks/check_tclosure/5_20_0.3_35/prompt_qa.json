    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether three nodes in the dynamic graph formed a closed triad. A closed triad is composed of three nodes which have linked with each other some time. \nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 5, 0), (1, 8, 0), (1, 12, 0), (1, 13, 0), (2, 19, 0), (3, 5, 0), (4, 14, 0), (4, 16, 0), (4, 18, 0), (6, 17, 0), (8, 10, 0), (8, 16, 0), (0, 5, 1), (0, 18, 1), (1, 6, 1), (1, 14, 1), (3, 8, 1), (4, 6, 1), (5, 15, 1), (6, 7, 1), (6, 12, 1), (10, 13, 1), (13, 15, 1), (3, 12, 2), (6, 9, 2), (7, 11, 2), (7, 18, 2), (7, 19, 2), (9, 12, 2), (11, 17, 2), (12, 17, 2), (16, 17, 2), (16, 19, 2), (1, 9, 3), (1, 10, 3), (2, 14, 3), (3, 13, 3), (3, 16, 3), (3, 19, 3), (4, 9, 3), (8, 11, 3), (10, 16, 3), (12, 19, 3), (14, 19, 3), (18, 19, 3), (0, 11, 4), (1, 3, 4), (2, 5, 4), (3, 10, 4), (5, 6, 4), (5, 12, 4), (9, 17, 4), (11, 19, 4), (12, 14, 4), (13, 18, 4), (15, 16, 4), (15, 19, 4)]. Did the three nodes [3, 19, 12] form a closed triad?\n",
