    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether three nodes in the dynamic graph formed a closed triad. A closed triad is composed of three nodes which have linked with each other some time. \nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 8, 0), (0, 17, 0), (2, 5, 0), (3, 17, 0), (4, 6, 0), (8, 18, 0), (11, 13, 0), (15, 18, 0), (15, 19, 0), (0, 19, 1), (2, 7, 1), (2, 12, 1), (3, 6, 1), (3, 8, 1), (3, 16, 1), (4, 9, 1), (4, 13, 1), (5, 6, 1), (5, 17, 1), (6, 9, 1), (6, 16, 1), (9, 12, 1), (15, 17, 1), (0, 7, 2), (0, 12, 2), (0, 13, 2), (0, 18, 2), (1, 7, 2), (1, 12, 2), (3, 9, 2), (9, 19, 2), (11, 16, 2), (11, 19, 2), (12, 14, 2), (13, 18, 2), (16, 17, 2), (0, 9, 3), (2, 9, 3), (3, 10, 3), (4, 16, 3), (5, 19, 3), (6, 10, 3), (6, 13, 3), (7, 10, 3), (7, 16, 3), (9, 18, 3), (12, 17, 3), (14, 16, 3), (0, 10, 4), (1, 17, 4), (2, 19, 4), (3, 4, 4), (4, 5, 4), (4, 11, 4), (4, 12, 4), (4, 14, 4), (5, 9, 4), (7, 14, 4), (8, 10, 4), (10, 14, 4), (12, 13, 4)]. Did the three nodes [9, 5, 2] form a closed triad?\n",
