    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether three nodes in the dynamic graph formed a closed triad. A closed triad is composed of three nodes which have linked with each other some time. \nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 2, 0), (0, 7, 0), (1, 8, 0), (1, 14, 0), (4, 6, 0), (4, 8, 0), (4, 13, 0), (5, 11, 0), (5, 15, 0), (6, 11, 0), (7, 19, 0), (10, 18, 0), (11, 19, 0), (12, 17, 0), (15, 16, 0), (0, 5, 1), (2, 7, 1), (3, 14, 1), (4, 5, 1), (5, 7, 1), (5, 12, 1), (5, 16, 1), (7, 12, 1), (8, 11, 1), (14, 18, 1), (2, 11, 2), (3, 11, 2), (3, 15, 2), (7, 17, 2), (13, 15, 2), (16, 18, 2), (0, 16, 3), (0, 17, 3), (1, 9, 3), (1, 16, 3), (3, 7, 3), (7, 13, 3), (10, 16, 3), (11, 15, 3), (12, 18, 3), (16, 17, 3), (0, 8, 4), (0, 11, 4), (1, 4, 4), (1, 10, 4), (1, 11, 4), (2, 5, 4), (2, 15, 4), (3, 10, 4), (3, 19, 4), (4, 10, 4), (4, 14, 4), (4, 16, 4), (5, 14, 4), (8, 18, 4), (8, 19, 4), (9, 14, 4), (9, 15, 4), (10, 12, 4)]. Did the three nodes [15, 3, 16] form a closed triad?\n",
