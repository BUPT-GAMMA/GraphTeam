    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(2, 16, 0), (8, 12, 0), (9, 10, 0), (14, 16, 0), (14, 19, 0), (0, 4, 1), (0, 15, 1), (1, 4, 1), (2, 11, 1), (3, 19, 1), (5, 8, 1), (6, 17, 1), (7, 8, 1), (7, 13, 1), (7, 14, 1), (8, 17, 1), (14, 15, 1), (14, 17, 1), (16, 19, 1), (1, 15, 2), (2, 19, 2), (3, 9, 2), (3, 17, 2), (4, 8, 2), (4, 17, 2), (6, 18, 2), (7, 17, 2), (11, 14, 2), (0, 3, 3), (1, 18, 3), (2, 13, 3), (2, 15, 3), (3, 11, 3), (3, 15, 3), (4, 6, 3), (5, 18, 3), (7, 9, 3), (7, 10, 3), (7, 15, 3), (7, 18, 3), (8, 10, 3), (9, 12, 3), (9, 13, 3), (12, 16, 3), (16, 18, 3), (0, 17, 4), (1, 7, 4), (4, 9, 4), (4, 16, 4), (10, 17, 4), (13, 18, 4)]. When did the three nodes [8, 4, 17] first close the triad?\n",
