    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 2, 0), (0, 16, 0), (0, 17, 0), (1, 3, 0), (1, 6, 0), (1, 17, 0), (4, 17, 0), (7, 8, 0), (8, 15, 0), (15, 16, 0), (0, 8, 1), (2, 10, 1), (4, 16, 1), (8, 18, 1), (9, 13, 1), (10, 16, 1), (10, 19, 1), (12, 19, 1), (0, 18, 2), (1, 15, 2), (2, 4, 2), (2, 6, 2), (2, 7, 2), (2, 9, 2), (3, 4, 2), (3, 16, 2), (3, 17, 2), (4, 19, 2), (5, 17, 2), (6, 9, 2), (6, 10, 2), (6, 19, 2), (8, 17, 2), (11, 19, 2), (13, 17, 2), (14, 16, 2), (0, 6, 3), (0, 13, 3), (1, 10, 3), (3, 9, 3), (6, 15, 3), (7, 13, 3), (7, 17, 3), (7, 18, 3), (9, 11, 3), (10, 13, 3), (13, 18, 3), (14, 17, 3), (0, 11, 4), (0, 19, 4), (1, 4, 4), (1, 14, 4), (2, 11, 4), (3, 11, 4), (3, 18, 4), (4, 18, 4), (5, 8, 4), (5, 13, 4), (6, 11, 4), (6, 14, 4), (8, 13, 4), (10, 14, 4), (10, 18, 4), (11, 15, 4), (13, 19, 4), (16, 17, 4)].
