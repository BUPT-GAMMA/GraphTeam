    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 8, 0), (0, 9, 0), (0, 17, 0), (1, 11, 0), (1, 12, 0), (1, 16, 0), (1, 19, 0), (2, 4, 0), (2, 10, 0), (6, 7, 0), (6, 8, 0), (6, 17, 0), (7, 10, 0), (7, 14, 0), (7, 15, 0), (8, 12, 0), (8, 14, 0), (9, 13, 0), (10, 17, 0), (11, 17, 0), (12, 19, 0), (0, 11, 1), (1, 3, 1), (1, 10, 1), (2, 3, 1), (2, 16, 1), (5, 9, 1), (6, 16, 1), (9, 12, 1), (0, 10, 2), (0, 19, 2), (2, 12, 2), (3, 7, 2), (3, 13, 2), (4, 5, 2), (4, 7, 2), (5, 11, 2), (8, 15, 2), (10, 13, 2), (10, 14, 2), (11, 16, 2), (11, 19, 2), (0, 3, 3), (0, 7, 3), (1, 4, 3), (1, 15, 3), (3, 6, 3), (3, 18, 3), (5, 12, 3), (7, 8, 3), (8, 18, 3), (9, 16, 3), (10, 16, 3), (13, 14, 3), (13, 19, 3), (14, 19, 3), (15, 17, 3), (2, 9, 4), (5, 8, 4), (9, 10, 4), (14, 18, 4), (16, 17, 4)]. When did the three nodes [1, 12, 19] first close the triad?\n",
