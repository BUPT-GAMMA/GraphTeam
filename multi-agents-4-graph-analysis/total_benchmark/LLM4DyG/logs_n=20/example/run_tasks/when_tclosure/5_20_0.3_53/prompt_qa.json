    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 16, 0), (0, 19, 0), (4, 5, 0), (4, 14, 0), (6, 7, 0), (7, 10, 0), (8, 11, 0), (9, 12, 0), (11, 13, 0), (11, 18, 0), (0, 10, 1), (1, 9, 1), (2, 5, 1), (2, 16, 1), (3, 9, 1), (7, 12, 1), (9, 15, 1), (17, 18, 1), (1, 2, 2), (1, 10, 2), (1, 14, 2), (1, 19, 2), (2, 14, 2), (3, 10, 2), (4, 7, 2), (4, 11, 2), (6, 11, 2), (11, 15, 2), (11, 19, 2), (14, 15, 2), (0, 11, 3), (2, 6, 3), (2, 10, 3), (2, 18, 3), (3, 15, 3), (3, 16, 3), (4, 19, 3), (5, 7, 3), (5, 12, 3), (10, 11, 3), (10, 16, 3), (0, 14, 4), (1, 8, 4), (2, 7, 4), (3, 18, 4), (4, 15, 4), (5, 14, 4), (7, 13, 4), (7, 15, 4), (7, 19, 4), (10, 15, 4)]. When did the three nodes [7, 10, 15] first close the triad?\n",
