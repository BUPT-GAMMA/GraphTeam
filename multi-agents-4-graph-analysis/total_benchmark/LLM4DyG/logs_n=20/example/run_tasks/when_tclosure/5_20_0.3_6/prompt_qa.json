    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 11, 0), (3, 11, 0), (6, 14, 0), (10, 12, 0), (17, 18, 0), (17, 19, 0), (0, 5, 1), (1, 12, 1), (1, 14, 1), (2, 10, 1), (2, 18, 1), (3, 8, 1), (5, 15, 1), (6, 7, 1), (9, 10, 1), (12, 19, 1), (14, 19, 1), (15, 19, 1), (0, 4, 2), (1, 2, 2), (1, 7, 2), (2, 15, 2), (3, 13, 2), (5, 10, 2), (5, 12, 2), (5, 16, 2), (6, 17, 2), (8, 9, 2), (9, 11, 2), (9, 19, 2), (10, 15, 2), (10, 17, 2), (10, 18, 2), (13, 19, 2), (0, 11, 3), (1, 17, 3), (4, 12, 3), (5, 17, 3), (8, 10, 3), (8, 15, 3), (11, 16, 3), (11, 18, 3), (14, 16, 3), (15, 17, 3), (0, 17, 4), (3, 5, 4), (3, 7, 4), (4, 5, 4), (4, 7, 4), (6, 10, 4), (8, 12, 4), (8, 13, 4)].
