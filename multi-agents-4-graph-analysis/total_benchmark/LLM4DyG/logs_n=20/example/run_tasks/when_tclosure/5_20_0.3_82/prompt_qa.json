    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 3, 0), (3, 6, 0), (4, 18, 0), (4, 19, 0), (5, 16, 0), (5, 18, 0), (7, 10, 0), (10, 13, 0), (12, 16, 0), (13, 17, 0), (16, 19, 0), (1, 15, 1), (1, 19, 1), (2, 6, 1), (3, 11, 1), (4, 8, 1), (4, 11, 1), (5, 7, 1), (6, 11, 1), (8, 9, 1), (8, 12, 1), (11, 12, 1), (11, 14, 1), (11, 19, 1), (16, 17, 1), (0, 8, 2), (0, 16, 2), (1, 4, 2), (7, 19, 2), (9, 14, 2), (12, 17, 2), (13, 16, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 12, 3), (0, 15, 3), (2, 3, 3), (2, 4, 3), (2, 5, 3), (4, 14, 3), (5, 10, 3), (6, 10, 3), (6, 13, 3), (6, 14, 3), (13, 18, 3), (1, 16, 4), (2, 10, 4), (4, 17, 4), (5, 15, 4), (7, 15, 4), (7, 18, 4), (8, 10, 4), (8, 13, 4), (9, 13, 4), (10, 11, 4), (14, 15, 4), (17, 18, 4)]. When did the three nodes [5, 7, 10] first close the triad?\n",
