    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 5, 0), (1, 5, 0), (1, 7, 0), (2, 4, 0), (2, 13, 0), (2, 16, 0), (2, 19, 0), (3, 18, 0), (4, 14, 0), (5, 18, 0), (8, 11, 0), (10, 18, 0), (0, 13, 1), (1, 10, 1), (2, 17, 1), (3, 19, 1), (4, 16, 1), (5, 16, 1), (6, 11, 1), (7, 16, 1), (8, 10, 1), (8, 13, 1), (9, 12, 1), (9, 16, 1), (11, 18, 1), (13, 18, 1), (15, 16, 1), (0, 14, 2), (1, 2, 2), (1, 9, 2), (2, 8, 2), (2, 10, 2), (5, 11, 2), (5, 15, 2), (6, 7, 2), (8, 19, 2), (10, 16, 2), (0, 1, 3), (1, 18, 3), (3, 5, 3), (3, 15, 3), (4, 7, 3), (4, 19, 3), (5, 7, 3), (5, 14, 3), (6, 8, 3), (8, 9, 3), (8, 14, 3), (12, 18, 3), (14, 18, 3), (0, 6, 4), (0, 17, 4), (2, 5, 4), (2, 15, 4), (3, 13, 4), (5, 17, 4), (9, 13, 4), (9, 14, 4), (9, 18, 4), (11, 14, 4), (13, 15, 4), (15, 19, 4), (16, 18, 4)]. When did the three nodes [13, 3, 18] first close the triad?\n",
