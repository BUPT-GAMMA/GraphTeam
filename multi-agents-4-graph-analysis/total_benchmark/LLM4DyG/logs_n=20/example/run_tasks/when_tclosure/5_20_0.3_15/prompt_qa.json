    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 2, 0), (0, 6, 0), (1, 2, 0), (2, 11, 0), (3, 6, 0), (4, 16, 0), (5, 11, 0), (5, 12, 0), (6, 12, 0), (8, 14, 0), (9, 13, 0), (11, 12, 0), (12, 13, 0), (12, 15, 0), (14, 18, 0), (0, 16, 1), (1, 19, 1), (2, 13, 1), (2, 19, 1), (4, 12, 1), (4, 17, 1), (10, 17, 1), (13, 15, 1), (1, 5, 2), (2, 12, 2), (3, 13, 2), (3, 17, 2), (4, 9, 2), (5, 10, 2), (7, 17, 2), (8, 9, 2), (13, 17, 2), (0, 14, 3), (0, 15, 3), (2, 3, 3), (4, 8, 3), (6, 18, 3), (8, 15, 3), (10, 14, 3), (15, 17, 3), (0, 4, 4), (0, 11, 4), (1, 8, 4), (2, 4, 4), (2, 8, 4), (6, 17, 4), (7, 16, 4), (9, 15, 4), (12, 14, 4), (12, 17, 4), (14, 19, 4)]. When did the three nodes [2, 4, 8] first close the triad?\n",
