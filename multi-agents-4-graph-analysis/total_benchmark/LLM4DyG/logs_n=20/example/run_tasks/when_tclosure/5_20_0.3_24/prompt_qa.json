    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 7, 0), (4, 13, 0), (7, 14, 0), (10, 12, 0), (11, 14, 0), (11, 16, 0), (13, 16, 0), (14, 15, 0), (0, 9, 1), (0, 16, 1), (1, 5, 1), (3, 8, 1), (3, 17, 1), (5, 9, 1), (5, 14, 1), (6, 8, 1), (6, 14, 1), (6, 16, 1), (7, 9, 1), (8, 11, 1), (8, 12, 1), (9, 17, 1), (9, 19, 1), (11, 15, 1), (0, 3, 2), (2, 10, 2), (3, 16, 2), (7, 11, 2), (7, 18, 2), (9, 18, 2), (11, 13, 2), (12, 17, 2), (14, 17, 2), (0, 5, 3), (1, 17, 3), (2, 7, 3), (2, 12, 3), (2, 13, 3), (2, 17, 3), (3, 6, 3), (4, 6, 3), (7, 12, 3), (8, 10, 3), (8, 14, 3), (10, 16, 3), (12, 16, 3), (12, 18, 3), (15, 17, 3), (1, 8, 4), (1, 18, 4), (4, 8, 4), (5, 7, 4), (5, 15, 4), (8, 18, 4), (10, 14, 4), (13, 15, 4), (16, 19, 4)]. When did the three nodes [7, 14, 5] first close the triad?\n",
