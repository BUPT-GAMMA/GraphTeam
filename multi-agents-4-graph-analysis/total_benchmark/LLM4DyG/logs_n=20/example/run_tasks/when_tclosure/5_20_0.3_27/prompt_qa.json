    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 5, 0), (0, 10, 0), (0, 13, 0), (0, 16, 0), (1, 4, 0), (3, 16, 0), (5, 14, 0), (6, 11, 0), (7, 15, 0), (8, 17, 0), (9, 12, 0), (10, 18, 0), (12, 18, 0), (1, 7, 1), (1, 13, 1), (2, 7, 1), (3, 4, 1), (5, 15, 1), (8, 12, 1), (8, 15, 1), (10, 12, 1), (13, 18, 1), (2, 3, 2), (2, 5, 2), (2, 9, 2), (3, 15, 2), (4, 15, 2), (4, 19, 2), (6, 9, 2), (6, 18, 2), (15, 19, 2), (17, 19, 2), (0, 4, 3), (3, 11, 3), (3, 13, 3), (3, 19, 3), (4, 14, 3), (5, 9, 3), (6, 12, 3), (6, 15, 3), (7, 13, 3), (11, 19, 3), (3, 8, 4), (4, 9, 4), (4, 17, 4), (8, 9, 4), (8, 19, 4), (9, 19, 4), (11, 12, 4), (12, 16, 4)]. When did the three nodes [5, 9, 2] first close the triad?\n",
