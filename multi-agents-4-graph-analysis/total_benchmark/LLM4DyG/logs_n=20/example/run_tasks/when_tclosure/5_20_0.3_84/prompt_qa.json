    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 14, 0), (1, 3, 0), (2, 12, 0), (2, 19, 0), (3, 6, 0), (5, 7, 0), (6, 15, 0), (9, 13, 0), (9, 17, 0), (13, 19, 0), (0, 4, 1), (0, 7, 1), (1, 5, 1), (1, 13, 1), (1, 14, 1), (2, 8, 1), (6, 10, 1), (6, 19, 1), (7, 11, 1), (7, 14, 1), (12, 19, 1), (0, 3, 2), (1, 9, 2), (1, 10, 2), (1, 18, 2), (4, 7, 2), (4, 13, 2), (5, 14, 2), (6, 8, 2), (6, 16, 2), (9, 14, 2), (5, 8, 3), (10, 19, 3), (11, 14, 3), (11, 19, 3), (14, 16, 3), (17, 18, 3), (0, 19, 4), (1, 12, 4), (2, 11, 4), (3, 8, 4), (3, 13, 4), (4, 6, 4), (5, 13, 4), (6, 7, 4), (12, 17, 4), (16, 18, 4)]. When did the three nodes [6, 7, 4] first close the triad?\n",
