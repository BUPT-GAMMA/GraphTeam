    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 2, 0), (0, 10, 0), (0, 15, 0), (1, 3, 0), (2, 18, 0), (3, 8, 0), (4, 9, 0), (5, 12, 0), (7, 12, 0), (8, 10, 0), (9, 12, 0), (9, 17, 0), (12, 15, 0), (15, 18, 0), (17, 19, 0), (0, 12, 1), (0, 16, 1), (1, 7, 1), (1, 18, 1), (5, 9, 1), (6, 9, 1), (7, 17, 1), (12, 14, 1), (13, 17, 1), (1, 19, 2), (2, 6, 2), (2, 8, 2), (2, 11, 2), (2, 16, 2), (4, 13, 2), (6, 19, 2), (7, 15, 2), (9, 11, 2), (13, 14, 2), (3, 6, 3), (3, 13, 3), (4, 18, 3), (5, 13, 3), (5, 16, 3), (5, 19, 3), (7, 13, 3), (14, 15, 3), (2, 4, 4), (3, 12, 4), (6, 8, 4), (7, 8, 4), (8, 11, 4), (8, 12, 4), (9, 13, 4), (9, 14, 4), (10, 18, 4), (12, 13, 4), (13, 16, 4)]. When did the three nodes [9, 5, 12] first close the triad?\n",
