    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 2, 0), (1, 19, 0), (2, 15, 0), (3, 8, 0), (3, 18, 0), (6, 15, 0), (6, 19, 0), (8, 9, 0), (12, 18, 0), (15, 19, 0), (1, 11, 1), (1, 14, 1), (2, 14, 1), (3, 5, 1), (3, 15, 1), (5, 11, 1), (5, 15, 1), (7, 15, 1), (7, 17, 1), (9, 19, 1), (0, 7, 2), (0, 13, 2), (3, 10, 2), (4, 15, 2), (5, 9, 2), (5, 17, 2), (6, 13, 2), (7, 12, 2), (8, 13, 2), (8, 16, 2), (9, 15, 2), (10, 16, 2), (10, 17, 2), (11, 13, 2), (14, 16, 2), (1, 17, 3), (2, 3, 3), (2, 12, 3), (5, 12, 3), (6, 16, 3), (8, 11, 3), (8, 14, 3), (9, 10, 3), (10, 15, 3), (10, 18, 3), (13, 15, 3), (13, 19, 3), (17, 19, 3), (0, 4, 4), (0, 9, 4), (1, 5, 4), (1, 8, 4), (1, 12, 4), (2, 5, 4), (3, 9, 4), (3, 14, 4), (5, 8, 4), (5, 19, 4), (6, 9, 4), (7, 11, 4), (8, 19, 4), (12, 15, 4), (14, 17, 4), (15, 16, 4)].
