    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 3, 0), (0, 19, 0), (5, 14, 0), (5, 17, 0), (6, 11, 0), (9, 15, 0), (11, 13, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 5, 1), (1, 5, 1), (4, 15, 1), (5, 8, 1), (8, 11, 1), (10, 12, 1), (12, 13, 1), (12, 17, 1), (13, 18, 1), (14, 15, 1), (1, 11, 2), (4, 5, 2), (4, 13, 2), (8, 12, 2), (9, 19, 2), (2, 16, 3), (2, 19, 3), (8, 14, 3), (8, 16, 3), (9, 10, 3), (9, 13, 3), (10, 16, 3), (17, 19, 3), (18, 19, 3), (1, 2, 4), (2, 5, 4), (2, 8, 4), (2, 11, 4), (2, 13, 4), (3, 18, 4), (4, 10, 4), (5, 10, 4), (6, 16, 4), (6, 18, 4), (8, 19, 4), (13, 14, 4)]. When did the three nodes [8, 2, 16] first close the triad?\n",
