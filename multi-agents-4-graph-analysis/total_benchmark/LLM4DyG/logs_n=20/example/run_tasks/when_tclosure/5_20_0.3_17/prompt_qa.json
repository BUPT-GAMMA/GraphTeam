    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 9, 0), (2, 4, 0), (4, 12, 0), (5, 9, 0), (6, 16, 0), (11, 14, 0), (13, 16, 0), (14, 18, 0), (15, 16, 0), (0, 4, 1), (0, 8, 1), (1, 8, 1), (1, 13, 1), (1, 17, 1), (3, 15, 1), (3, 16, 1), (4, 5, 1), (4, 9, 1), (5, 8, 1), (6, 11, 1), (6, 15, 1), (11, 15, 1), (12, 19, 1), (14, 16, 1), (2, 6, 2), (2, 13, 2), (5, 6, 2), (5, 16, 2), (6, 10, 2), (7, 17, 2), (10, 16, 2), (11, 18, 2), (12, 16, 2), (2, 18, 3), (3, 4, 3), (3, 8, 3), (5, 10, 3), (5, 18, 3), (6, 17, 3), (7, 15, 3), (7, 19, 3), (9, 16, 3), (10, 17, 3), (0, 12, 4), (0, 19, 4), (1, 4, 4), (5, 7, 4), (6, 13, 4), (16, 19, 4)]. When did the three nodes [0, 12, 19] first close the triad?\n",
