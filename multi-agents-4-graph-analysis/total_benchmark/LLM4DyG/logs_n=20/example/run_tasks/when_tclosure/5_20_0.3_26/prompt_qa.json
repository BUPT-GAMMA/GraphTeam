    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 2, 0), (0, 18, 0), (1, 15, 0), (2, 12, 0), (3, 5, 0), (5, 18, 0), (6, 8, 0), (6, 15, 0), (6, 19, 0), (8, 10, 0), (8, 12, 0), (9, 19, 0), (10, 12, 0), (10, 14, 0), (11, 16, 0), (12, 16, 0), (15, 19, 0), (16, 18, 0), (17, 18, 0), (0, 3, 1), (1, 9, 1), (1, 13, 1), (5, 11, 1), (5, 14, 1), (9, 12, 1), (10, 15, 1), (10, 17, 1), (10, 19, 1), (13, 19, 1), (15, 18, 1), (0, 8, 2), (1, 3, 2), (2, 5, 2), (2, 13, 2), (3, 7, 2), (3, 14, 2), (8, 17, 2), (9, 10, 2), (13, 14, 2), (14, 18, 2), (0, 5, 3), (1, 11, 3), (2, 7, 3), (3, 16, 3), (4, 12, 3), (4, 13, 3), (5, 8, 3), (5, 15, 3), (7, 17, 3), (8, 18, 3), (10, 16, 3), (10, 18, 3), (11, 18, 3), (12, 17, 3), (13, 18, 3), (16, 19, 3), (1, 2, 4), (1, 14, 4), (2, 16, 4), (3, 12, 4), (3, 13, 4), (3, 15, 4), (5, 9, 4), (5, 13, 4), (5, 17, 4), (7, 18, 4), (7, 19, 4), (8, 9, 4), (8, 14, 4), (12, 19, 4), (14, 15, 4)].
