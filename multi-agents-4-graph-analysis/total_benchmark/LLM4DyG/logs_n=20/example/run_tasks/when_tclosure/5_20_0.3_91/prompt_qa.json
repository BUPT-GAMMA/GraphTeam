    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(2, 8, 0), (4, 12, 0), (6, 16, 0), (10, 12, 0), (11, 18, 0), (14, 17, 0), (2, 5, 1), (2, 7, 1), (3, 16, 1), (4, 16, 1), (5, 13, 1), (6, 14, 1), (6, 15, 1), (9, 19, 1), (10, 13, 1), (0, 1, 2), (0, 2, 2), (0, 4, 2), (0, 18, 2), (1, 19, 2), (3, 12, 2), (4, 6, 2), (4, 19, 2), (6, 8, 2), (7, 10, 2), (7, 18, 2), (8, 9, 2), (8, 16, 2), (10, 11, 2), (10, 19, 2), (13, 16, 2), (13, 19, 2), (18, 19, 2), (5, 15, 3), (5, 16, 3), (6, 19, 3), (8, 11, 3), (9, 11, 3), (9, 15, 3), (14, 19, 3), (0, 10, 4), (0, 15, 4), (1, 18, 4), (2, 3, 4), (4, 9, 4), (5, 9, 4), (6, 7, 4), (7, 11, 4), (9, 13, 4), (11, 12, 4), (13, 18, 4)]. When did the three nodes [8, 11, 9] first close the triad?\n",
