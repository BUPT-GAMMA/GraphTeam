    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 2, 0), (1, 3, 0), (1, 17, 0), (2, 6, 0), (4, 10, 0), (5, 18, 0), (6, 8, 0), (6, 12, 0), (8, 10, 0), (14, 19, 0), (0, 13, 1), (1, 5, 1), (1, 6, 1), (1, 10, 1), (2, 8, 1), (3, 4, 1), (3, 10, 1), (4, 15, 1), (6, 15, 1), (9, 10, 1), (9, 15, 1), (9, 17, 1), (10, 14, 1), (0, 2, 2), (2, 16, 2), (3, 7, 2), (3, 17, 2), (5, 16, 2), (7, 17, 2), (8, 9, 2), (8, 13, 2), (2, 10, 3), (3, 12, 3), (5, 19, 3), (6, 7, 3), (6, 11, 3), (6, 17, 3), (7, 9, 3), (7, 11, 3), (8, 16, 3), (8, 19, 3), (10, 17, 3), (11, 17, 3), (15, 19, 3), (17, 19, 3), (1, 11, 4), (1, 12, 4), (1, 13, 4), (1, 16, 4), (3, 8, 4), (5, 9, 4), (6, 18, 4), (7, 16, 4), (9, 11, 4), (11, 15, 4), (11, 16, 4), (11, 19, 4), (13, 18, 4), (13, 19, 4)]. When did the three nodes [8, 19, 13] first close the triad?\n",
