    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 5, 0), (1, 4, 0), (2, 6, 0), (3, 17, 0), (3, 19, 0), (9, 17, 0), (16, 18, 0), (3, 8, 1), (6, 8, 1), (6, 12, 1), (7, 12, 1), (8, 13, 1), (8, 19, 1), (9, 12, 1), (10, 13, 1), (10, 19, 1), (11, 13, 1), (12, 13, 1), (1, 19, 2), (2, 8, 2), (2, 18, 2), (4, 14, 2), (4, 16, 2), (6, 19, 2), (7, 11, 2), (9, 11, 2), (17, 18, 2), (0, 10, 3), (4, 9, 3), (6, 15, 3), (6, 16, 3), (7, 8, 3), (7, 9, 3), (7, 13, 3), (8, 9, 3), (9, 10, 3), (10, 11, 3), (13, 15, 3), (13, 16, 3), (15, 19, 3), (0, 2, 4), (0, 3, 4), (0, 6, 4), (0, 18, 4), (1, 13, 4), (2, 5, 4), (4, 10, 4), (7, 15, 4), (8, 12, 4), (9, 14, 4), (10, 15, 4), (11, 17, 4), (13, 14, 4), (14, 17, 4), (16, 17, 4)]. When did the three nodes [8, 7, 13] first close the triad?\n",
