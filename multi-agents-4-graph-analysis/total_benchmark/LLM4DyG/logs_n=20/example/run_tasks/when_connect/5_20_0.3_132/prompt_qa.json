    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(2, 15, 0), (3, 10, 0), (6, 13, 0), (7, 11, 0), (7, 15, 0), (9, 16, 0), (12, 15, 0), (15, 17, 0), (17, 19, 0), (18, 19, 0), (0, 9, 1), (0, 13, 1), (3, 14, 1), (4, 7, 1), (4, 13, 1), (5, 12, 1), (8, 15, 1), (10, 11, 1), (10, 12, 1), (12, 17, 1), (14, 15, 1), (0, 11, 2), (1, 11, 2), (1, 19, 2), (2, 3, 2), (2, 4, 2), (2, 6, 2), (2, 7, 2), (6, 14, 2), (8, 16, 2), (9, 10, 2), (11, 13, 2), (14, 16, 2), (15, 16, 2), (3, 5, 3), (3, 11, 3), (4, 17, 3), (8, 12, 3), (9, 18, 3), (10, 14, 3), (10, 15, 3), (2, 18, 4), (3, 6, 4), (5, 15, 4), (7, 9, 4), (9, 17, 4), (16, 19, 4)].
