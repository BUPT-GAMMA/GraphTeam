    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 5, 0), (0, 16, 0), (0, 19, 0), (2, 12, 0), (2, 16, 0), (4, 18, 0), (5, 9, 0), (5, 12, 0), (7, 17, 0), (7, 19, 0), (11, 18, 0), (11, 19, 0), (12, 18, 0), (13, 19, 0), (14, 19, 0), (15, 19, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 6, 1), (2, 11, 1), (2, 13, 1), (3, 4, 1), (4, 17, 1), (6, 17, 1), (9, 18, 1), (11, 17, 1), (13, 17, 1), (15, 17, 1), (0, 7, 2), (0, 11, 2), (0, 12, 2), (0, 14, 2), (1, 2, 2), (1, 8, 2), (1, 12, 2), (3, 11, 2), (5, 14, 2), (8, 17, 2), (9, 17, 2), (13, 18, 2), (16, 17, 2), (17, 19, 2), (18, 19, 2), (2, 5, 3), (3, 8, 3), (3, 12, 3), (4, 7, 3), (4, 10, 3), (5, 7, 3), (6, 7, 3), (6, 10, 3), (6, 19, 3), (7, 12, 3), (10, 15, 3), (10, 17, 3), (14, 16, 3), (16, 19, 3), (17, 18, 3), (3, 6, 4), (5, 18, 4), (6, 9, 4), (7, 11, 4), (7, 13, 4), (8, 12, 4), (9, 10, 4), (9, 15, 4), (10, 13, 4)].
