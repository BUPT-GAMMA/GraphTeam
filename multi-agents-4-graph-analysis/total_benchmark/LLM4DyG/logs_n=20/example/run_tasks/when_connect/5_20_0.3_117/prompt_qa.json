    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 1, 0), (0, 2, 0), (1, 9, 0), (4, 18, 0), (5, 14, 0), (6, 19, 0), (7, 8, 0), (11, 14, 0), (18, 19, 0), (0, 4, 1), (0, 11, 1), (0, 14, 1), (1, 13, 1), (3, 10, 1), (3, 11, 1), (4, 5, 1), (5, 10, 1), (6, 13, 1), (7, 14, 1), (10, 19, 1), (12, 13, 1), (15, 16, 1), (17, 18, 1), (1, 10, 2), (1, 17, 2), (2, 6, 2), (2, 11, 2), (3, 7, 2), (3, 14, 2), (6, 17, 2), (8, 19, 2), (13, 15, 2), (15, 18, 2), (0, 6, 3), (0, 17, 3), (1, 14, 3), (2, 7, 3), (5, 12, 3), (7, 16, 3), (9, 11, 3), (12, 15, 3), (16, 17, 3), (5, 11, 4), (6, 7, 4), (6, 15, 4), (8, 12, 4), (9, 16, 4), (10, 18, 4), (14, 15, 4), (14, 17, 4), (16, 19, 4), (17, 19, 4)].
