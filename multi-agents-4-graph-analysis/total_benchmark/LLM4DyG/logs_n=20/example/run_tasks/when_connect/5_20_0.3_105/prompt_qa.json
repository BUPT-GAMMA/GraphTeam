    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 8, 0), (1, 2, 0), (1, 8, 0), (2, 14, 0), (6, 9, 0), (7, 17, 0), (10, 11, 0), (15, 19, 0), (17, 19, 0), (0, 11, 1), (2, 17, 1), (2, 18, 1), (2, 19, 1), (3, 19, 1), (4, 12, 1), (5, 9, 1), (5, 13, 1), (7, 14, 1), (7, 15, 1), (10, 15, 1), (12, 16, 1), (14, 18, 1), (16, 17, 1), (4, 19, 2), (5, 6, 2), (6, 10, 2), (7, 16, 2), (8, 10, 2), (9, 18, 2), (3, 9, 3), (3, 11, 3), (7, 10, 3), (11, 12, 3), (14, 16, 3), (0, 14, 4), (1, 12, 4), (2, 16, 4), (3, 10, 4), (4, 8, 4), (4, 9, 4), (4, 16, 4), (5, 8, 4), (5, 15, 4), (6, 14, 4), (9, 12, 4), (9, 16, 4), (9, 19, 4), (12, 19, 4)].
