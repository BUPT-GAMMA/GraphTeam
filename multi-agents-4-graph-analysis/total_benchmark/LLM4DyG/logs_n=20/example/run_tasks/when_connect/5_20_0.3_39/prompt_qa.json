    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 9, 0), (1, 2, 0), (2, 5, 0), (2, 17, 0), (4, 11, 0), (4, 13, 0), (4, 15, 0), (5, 10, 0), (5, 13, 0), (6, 8, 0), (6, 12, 0), (6, 15, 0), (6, 16, 0), (7, 10, 0), (7, 18, 0), (9, 16, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 3, 1), (0, 7, 1), (2, 8, 1), (2, 16, 1), (4, 5, 1), (4, 17, 1), (5, 7, 1), (5, 8, 1), (6, 7, 1), (7, 8, 1), (8, 11, 1), (9, 14, 1), (9, 19, 1), (10, 16, 1), (11, 14, 1), (11, 16, 1), (12, 14, 1), (12, 18, 1), (5, 6, 2), (9, 18, 2), (11, 12, 2), (11, 19, 2), (12, 19, 2), (13, 18, 2), (14, 16, 2), (15, 16, 2), (16, 17, 2), (0, 13, 3), (0, 14, 3), (1, 7, 3), (1, 9, 3), (3, 17, 3), (5, 14, 3), (8, 18, 3), (9, 11, 3), (9, 13, 3), (15, 19, 3), (0, 11, 4), (1, 5, 4), (1, 10, 4), (2, 3, 4), (2, 11, 4), (3, 4, 4), (3, 8, 4), (3, 12, 4), (4, 6, 4), (5, 9, 4), (6, 19, 4), (12, 16, 4), (12, 17, 4), (13, 14, 4), (18, 19, 4)].
