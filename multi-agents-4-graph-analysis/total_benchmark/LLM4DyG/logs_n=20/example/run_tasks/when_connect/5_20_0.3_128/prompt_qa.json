    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 10, 0), (1, 12, 0), (2, 7, 0), (3, 16, 0), (4, 8, 0), (4, 11, 0), (5, 6, 0), (5, 16, 0), (6, 17, 0), (7, 16, 0), (9, 17, 0), (12, 19, 0), (0, 13, 1), (0, 19, 1), (1, 16, 1), (3, 10, 1), (8, 9, 1), (9, 13, 1), (12, 16, 1), (0, 2, 2), (0, 5, 2), (0, 6, 2), (0, 8, 2), (1, 14, 2), (3, 14, 2), (4, 7, 2), (7, 13, 2), (7, 15, 2), (10, 12, 2), (17, 19, 2), (0, 4, 3), (0, 14, 3), (2, 10, 3), (3, 6, 3), (3, 15, 3), (5, 9, 3), (7, 9, 3), (8, 11, 3), (8, 17, 3), (13, 17, 3), (0, 12, 4), (2, 8, 4), (4, 5, 4), (4, 12, 4), (5, 7, 4), (6, 14, 4), (7, 11, 4), (7, 12, 4), (8, 10, 4), (9, 18, 4), (10, 13, 4), (11, 13, 4), (11, 17, 4), (13, 16, 4)].
