    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(2, 14, 0), (2, 17, 0), (2, 18, 0), (3, 15, 0), (4, 15, 0), (5, 13, 0), (6, 17, 0), (8, 10, 0), (8, 15, 0), (10, 19, 0), (12, 13, 0), (0, 15, 1), (2, 6, 1), (3, 14, 1), (3, 18, 1), (4, 7, 1), (6, 11, 1), (7, 18, 1), (8, 18, 1), (9, 10, 1), (11, 13, 1), (0, 19, 2), (1, 9, 2), (3, 8, 2), (4, 16, 2), (10, 13, 2), (2, 7, 3), (3, 10, 3), (3, 12, 3), (4, 8, 3), (4, 9, 3), (5, 8, 3), (6, 9, 3), (7, 17, 3), (8, 12, 3), (9, 16, 3), (11, 15, 3), (15, 16, 3), (1, 10, 4), (1, 12, 4), (1, 15, 4), (2, 16, 4), (3, 7, 4), (3, 17, 4), (6, 14, 4), (6, 19, 4), (8, 13, 4), (12, 19, 4)].
