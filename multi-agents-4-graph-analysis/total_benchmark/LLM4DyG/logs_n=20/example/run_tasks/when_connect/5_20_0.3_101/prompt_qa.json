    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 11, 0), (0, 14, 0), (1, 7, 0), (2, 4, 0), (2, 10, 0), (3, 15, 0), (5, 7, 0), (5, 12, 0), (7, 12, 0), (8, 15, 0), (10, 11, 0), (11, 18, 0), (16, 19, 0), (0, 7, 1), (0, 9, 1), (2, 6, 1), (4, 5, 1), (5, 9, 1), (5, 11, 1), (7, 13, 1), (9, 15, 1), (11, 15, 1), (2, 9, 2), (3, 9, 2), (4, 12, 2), (6, 14, 2), (7, 15, 2), (9, 13, 2), (13, 18, 2), (14, 16, 2), (0, 2, 3), (0, 8, 3), (2, 8, 3), (2, 11, 3), (2, 12, 3), (3, 8, 3), (4, 6, 3), (5, 6, 3), (5, 17, 3), (6, 7, 3), (10, 18, 3), (11, 13, 3), (13, 17, 3), (13, 19, 3), (14, 17, 3), (16, 18, 3), (0, 13, 4), (0, 15, 4), (1, 4, 4), (1, 17, 4), (3, 10, 4), (4, 16, 4), (5, 13, 4), (6, 13, 4), (7, 8, 4), (7, 14, 4), (7, 16, 4), (9, 10, 4), (9, 14, 4), (12, 13, 4), (13, 14, 4), (14, 18, 4), (14, 19, 4)].
