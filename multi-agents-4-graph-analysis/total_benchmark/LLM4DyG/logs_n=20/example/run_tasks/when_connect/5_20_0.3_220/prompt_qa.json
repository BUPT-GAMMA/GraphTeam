    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 8, 0), (0, 15, 0), (1, 15, 0), (2, 5, 0), (3, 12, 0), (3, 15, 0), (4, 19, 0), (5, 9, 0), (6, 15, 0), (7, 15, 0), (7, 16, 0), (7, 18, 0), (8, 9, 0), (9, 13, 0), (9, 15, 0), (10, 14, 0), (12, 18, 0), (14, 16, 0), (1, 14, 1), (3, 5, 1), (3, 6, 1), (6, 18, 1), (7, 11, 1), (12, 15, 1), (14, 15, 1), (16, 17, 1), (0, 12, 2), (1, 2, 2), (2, 10, 2), (2, 18, 2), (3, 8, 2), (3, 14, 2), (3, 17, 2), (4, 12, 2), (5, 6, 2), (8, 18, 2), (9, 19, 2), (10, 16, 2), (13, 14, 2), (16, 19, 2), (0, 2, 3), (1, 6, 3), (1, 9, 3), (5, 10, 3), (5, 13, 3), (8, 14, 3), (12, 17, 3), (14, 18, 3), (0, 3, 4), (0, 4, 4), (1, 13, 4), (4, 8, 4), (4, 15, 4), (8, 11, 4), (9, 11, 4), (9, 18, 4)].
