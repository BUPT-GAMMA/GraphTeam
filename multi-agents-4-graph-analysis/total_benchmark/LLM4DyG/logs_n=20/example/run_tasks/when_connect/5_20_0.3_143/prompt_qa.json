    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(2, 7, 0), (2, 12, 0), (3, 18, 0), (7, 9, 0), (8, 17, 0), (12, 15, 0), (14, 15, 0), (15, 19, 0), (0, 3, 1), (0, 4, 1), (0, 5, 1), (1, 18, 1), (2, 5, 1), (2, 15, 1), (5, 6, 1), (7, 19, 1), (8, 10, 1), (11, 16, 1), (0, 12, 2), (0, 16, 2), (0, 19, 2), (1, 4, 2), (1, 7, 2), (2, 10, 2), (2, 17, 2), (4, 10, 2), (4, 16, 2), (5, 8, 2), (6, 7, 2), (6, 16, 2), (7, 14, 2), (8, 13, 2), (8, 19, 2), (9, 19, 2), (10, 19, 2), (11, 18, 2), (11, 19, 2), (13, 14, 2), (14, 18, 2), (2, 8, 3), (4, 8, 3), (6, 11, 3), (7, 10, 3), (8, 18, 3), (12, 16, 3), (14, 17, 3), (2, 18, 4), (3, 7, 4), (3, 14, 4), (3, 17, 4), (7, 11, 4), (7, 12, 4), (9, 10, 4), (10, 12, 4), (10, 15, 4), (15, 18, 4)].
