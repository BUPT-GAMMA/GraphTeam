    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(2, 4, 0), (3, 5, 0), (3, 13, 0), (5, 11, 0), (7, 14, 0), (8, 16, 0), (9, 12, 0), (9, 16, 0), (11, 17, 0), (14, 17, 0), (0, 5, 1), (1, 6, 1), (7, 13, 1), (7, 15, 1), (10, 14, 1), (11, 14, 1), (12, 15, 1), (2, 7, 2), (2, 19, 2), (3, 15, 2), (6, 10, 2), (6, 17, 2), (7, 11, 2), (8, 15, 2), (10, 15, 2), (14, 18, 2), (0, 17, 3), (1, 11, 3), (2, 5, 3), (2, 9, 3), (5, 10, 3), (5, 19, 3), (6, 7, 3), (7, 19, 3), (13, 14, 3), (14, 15, 3), (1, 3, 4), (1, 15, 4), (2, 3, 4), (2, 6, 4), (2, 8, 4), (3, 11, 4), (4, 13, 4), (5, 14, 4), (6, 9, 4), (6, 13, 4), (7, 12, 4), (9, 14, 4), (15, 16, 4), (17, 19, 4)].
