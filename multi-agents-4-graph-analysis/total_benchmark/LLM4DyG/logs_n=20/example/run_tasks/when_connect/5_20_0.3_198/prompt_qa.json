    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 18, 0), (1, 17, 0), (2, 17, 0), (2, 18, 0), (3, 5, 0), (3, 15, 0), (4, 5, 0), (4, 16, 0), (5, 11, 0), (7, 19, 0), (9, 13, 0), (10, 17, 0), (11, 19, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 6, 1), (1, 13, 1), (1, 15, 1), (3, 4, 1), (8, 12, 1), (8, 15, 1), (9, 10, 1), (9, 15, 1), (10, 13, 1), (11, 16, 1), (13, 15, 1), (14, 15, 1), (0, 3, 2), (0, 7, 2), (1, 5, 2), (1, 8, 2), (1, 9, 2), (2, 15, 2), (3, 10, 2), (4, 14, 2), (4, 19, 2), (9, 14, 2), (10, 15, 2), (11, 13, 2), (12, 16, 2), (12, 19, 2), (13, 18, 2), (15, 16, 2), (15, 19, 2), (1, 16, 3), (2, 13, 3), (5, 10, 3), (6, 8, 3), (7, 8, 3), (14, 17, 3), (0, 11, 4), (2, 19, 4), (5, 9, 4), (5, 13, 4), (6, 13, 4), (6, 19, 4), (7, 10, 4), (7, 13, 4), (7, 17, 4), (9, 12, 4), (10, 12, 4), (11, 14, 4), (11, 18, 4), (13, 17, 4), (13, 19, 4), (18, 19, 4)].
