    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 2, 0), (1, 5, 0), (3, 10, 0), (4, 15, 0), (5, 15, 0), (8, 19, 0), (9, 14, 0), (11, 12, 0), (4, 8, 1), (4, 10, 1), (4, 16, 1), (8, 13, 1), (10, 11, 1), (12, 18, 1), (0, 5, 2), (0, 16, 2), (5, 6, 2), (5, 17, 2), (7, 17, 2), (8, 10, 2), (9, 11, 2), (11, 18, 2), (11, 19, 2), (12, 14, 2), (2, 13, 3), (2, 18, 3), (3, 7, 3), (3, 18, 3), (4, 5, 3), (5, 13, 3), (6, 19, 3), (7, 12, 3), (11, 16, 3), (12, 15, 3), (0, 8, 4), (0, 18, 4), (1, 4, 4), (1, 18, 4), (2, 6, 4), (2, 9, 4), (5, 12, 4), (6, 16, 4), (6, 18, 4), (7, 8, 4), (7, 11, 4), (9, 19, 4), (12, 19, 4), (13, 16, 4), (13, 18, 4)].
