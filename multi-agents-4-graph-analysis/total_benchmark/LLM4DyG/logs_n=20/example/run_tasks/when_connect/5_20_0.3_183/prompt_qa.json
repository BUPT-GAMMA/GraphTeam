    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 17, 0), (0, 18, 0), (3, 8, 0), (4, 6, 0), (5, 6, 0), (5, 11, 0), (6, 9, 0), (6, 13, 0), (8, 18, 0), (9, 13, 0), (10, 12, 0), (10, 15, 0), (11, 17, 0), (12, 13, 0), (0, 3, 1), (2, 18, 1), (4, 18, 1), (5, 7, 1), (5, 18, 1), (6, 7, 1), (9, 14, 1), (11, 13, 1), (12, 14, 1), (16, 19, 1), (0, 11, 2), (2, 3, 2), (3, 19, 2), (4, 7, 2), (6, 14, 2), (7, 16, 2), (8, 15, 2), (13, 15, 2), (15, 16, 2), (15, 19, 2), (2, 4, 3), (2, 11, 3), (2, 13, 3), (2, 16, 3), (3, 16, 3), (3, 17, 3), (4, 8, 3), (4, 9, 3), (4, 12, 3), (5, 19, 3), (6, 17, 3), (7, 10, 3), (7, 11, 3), (10, 17, 3), (11, 16, 3), (15, 18, 3), (0, 1, 4), (0, 5, 4), (0, 8, 4), (1, 14, 4), (3, 14, 4), (4, 10, 4), (10, 13, 4), (10, 14, 4), (16, 17, 4), (16, 18, 4)].
