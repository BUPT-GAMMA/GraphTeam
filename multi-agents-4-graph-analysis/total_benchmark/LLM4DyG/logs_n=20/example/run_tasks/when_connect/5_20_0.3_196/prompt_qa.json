    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 11, 0), (0, 16, 0), (1, 10, 0), (1, 12, 0), (1, 17, 0), (2, 4, 0), (4, 12, 0), (7, 12, 0), (7, 19, 0), (8, 15, 0), (9, 18, 0), (10, 17, 0), (12, 14, 0), (12, 15, 0), (1, 6, 1), (3, 19, 1), (5, 11, 1), (8, 9, 1), (8, 12, 1), (9, 19, 1), (14, 18, 1), (0, 13, 2), (0, 14, 2), (1, 7, 2), (2, 16, 2), (3, 11, 2), (4, 14, 2), (11, 18, 2), (13, 15, 2), (0, 19, 3), (2, 19, 3), (3, 7, 3), (4, 5, 3), (5, 9, 3), (6, 19, 3), (7, 16, 3), (8, 11, 3), (15, 16, 3), (15, 19, 3), (0, 5, 4), (0, 12, 4), (2, 12, 4), (4, 6, 4), (4, 8, 4), (5, 17, 4), (5, 18, 4), (6, 11, 4), (6, 17, 4), (11, 12, 4), (12, 18, 4), (16, 19, 4)].
