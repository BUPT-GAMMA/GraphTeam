    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 15, 0), (1, 13, 0), (2, 3, 0), (3, 6, 0), (4, 13, 0), (6, 7, 0), (6, 18, 0), (7, 11, 0), (7, 15, 0), (9, 15, 0), (9, 16, 0), (10, 12, 0), (16, 17, 0), (17, 19, 0), (0, 3, 1), (0, 17, 1), (1, 7, 1), (1, 11, 1), (5, 16, 1), (6, 19, 1), (10, 11, 1), (10, 16, 1), (13, 18, 1), (0, 11, 2), (1, 9, 2), (1, 12, 2), (1, 18, 2), (2, 13, 2), (3, 15, 2), (4, 5, 2), (5, 11, 2), (5, 17, 2), (6, 11, 2), (6, 14, 2), (7, 16, 2), (9, 10, 2), (10, 13, 2), (11, 16, 2), (12, 14, 2), (12, 19, 2), (16, 18, 2), (0, 13, 3), (2, 5, 3), (3, 17, 3), (4, 14, 3), (6, 9, 3), (8, 12, 3), (11, 12, 3), (13, 16, 3), (13, 17, 3), (13, 19, 3), (18, 19, 3), (1, 15, 4), (2, 11, 4), (2, 14, 4), (4, 7, 4), (5, 7, 4), (7, 8, 4), (8, 11, 4), (15, 17, 4)].
