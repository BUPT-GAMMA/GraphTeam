    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 2, 0), (1, 13, 0), (3, 7, 0), (5, 15, 0), (6, 18, 0), (7, 17, 0), (9, 10, 0), (9, 11, 0), (9, 18, 0), (13, 16, 0), (15, 18, 0), (18, 19, 0), (0, 8, 1), (1, 8, 1), (1, 10, 1), (3, 5, 1), (6, 14, 1), (7, 14, 1), (8, 18, 1), (10, 13, 1), (11, 12, 1), (12, 13, 1), (12, 19, 1), (0, 7, 2), (1, 17, 2), (1, 19, 2), (3, 4, 2), (3, 15, 2), (4, 15, 2), (6, 11, 2), (7, 15, 2), (7, 16, 2), (8, 15, 2), (9, 16, 2), (16, 18, 2), (0, 10, 3), (2, 6, 3), (6, 10, 3), (6, 12, 3), (8, 13, 3), (9, 13, 3), (10, 14, 3), (12, 17, 3), (1, 5, 4), (6, 13, 4), (6, 17, 4), (10, 15, 4), (10, 16, 4), (10, 18, 4), (14, 18, 4), (15, 16, 4)].
