    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 13, 0), (1, 16, 0), (4, 6, 0), (7, 9, 0), (7, 13, 0), (7, 14, 0), (8, 12, 0), (13, 19, 0), (0, 1, 1), (0, 5, 1), (0, 17, 1), (2, 9, 1), (4, 7, 1), (4, 8, 1), (4, 10, 1), (6, 16, 1), (8, 18, 1), (9, 13, 1), (9, 15, 1), (13, 17, 1), (15, 17, 1), (0, 19, 2), (1, 5, 2), (2, 7, 2), (3, 14, 2), (4, 15, 2), (8, 11, 2), (10, 19, 2), (11, 13, 2), (12, 15, 2), (12, 18, 2), (16, 18, 2), (1, 7, 3), (1, 11, 3), (6, 11, 3), (11, 14, 3), (11, 17, 3), (0, 8, 4), (0, 13, 4), (0, 16, 4), (1, 3, 4), (2, 5, 4), (2, 17, 4), (5, 6, 4), (5, 18, 4), (8, 15, 4), (9, 18, 4), (13, 16, 4), (13, 18, 4), (17, 18, 4)].
