    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 18, 0), (1, 8, 0), (1, 13, 0), (1, 15, 0), (2, 12, 0), (3, 6, 0), (4, 9, 0), (4, 12, 0), (4, 17, 0), (5, 17, 0), (6, 10, 0), (6, 11, 0), (7, 9, 0), (9, 17, 0), (10, 14, 0), (11, 12, 0), (13, 17, 0), (15, 16, 0), (17, 19, 0), (0, 9, 1), (0, 10, 1), (1, 12, 1), (3, 11, 1), (3, 15, 1), (10, 15, 1), (10, 19, 1), (11, 19, 1), (12, 16, 1), (13, 14, 1), (13, 19, 1), (14, 17, 1), (0, 16, 2), (0, 19, 2), (2, 4, 2), (4, 8, 2), (4, 14, 2), (6, 13, 2), (8, 11, 2), (11, 15, 2), (11, 18, 2), (12, 19, 2), (0, 3, 3), (0, 17, 3), (1, 14, 3), (4, 18, 3), (5, 7, 3), (6, 15, 3), (7, 17, 3), (7, 18, 3), (7, 19, 3), (8, 9, 3), (8, 14, 3), (8, 17, 3), (9, 14, 3), (10, 16, 3), (12, 17, 3), (15, 18, 3), (16, 18, 3), (18, 19, 3), (0, 4, 4), (2, 5, 4), (2, 10, 4), (3, 7, 4), (4, 6, 4), (8, 13, 4), (13, 15, 4)].
