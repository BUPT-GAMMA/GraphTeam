    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 3, 0), (0, 18, 0), (1, 16, 0), (2, 7, 0), (2, 16, 0), (3, 6, 0), (3, 15, 0), (3, 18, 0), (5, 8, 0), (5, 13, 0), (6, 19, 0), (7, 10, 0), (9, 16, 0), (10, 18, 0), (11, 13, 0), (0, 4, 1), (0, 8, 1), (0, 12, 1), (1, 3, 1), (1, 13, 1), (2, 14, 1), (4, 7, 1), (4, 11, 1), (4, 14, 1), (6, 13, 1), (1, 7, 2), (2, 3, 2), (2, 11, 2), (2, 17, 2), (3, 11, 2), (3, 17, 2), (5, 7, 2), (7, 14, 2), (9, 13, 2), (13, 19, 2), (16, 17, 2), (0, 14, 3), (0, 16, 3), (2, 15, 3), (3, 4, 3), (3, 9, 3), (5, 9, 3), (6, 8, 3), (7, 19, 3), (8, 14, 3), (10, 11, 3), (10, 16, 3), (13, 18, 3), (1, 8, 4), (1, 10, 4), (3, 16, 4), (4, 6, 4), (5, 15, 4), (6, 16, 4), (8, 10, 4), (10, 15, 4), (11, 18, 4), (15, 16, 4)].
