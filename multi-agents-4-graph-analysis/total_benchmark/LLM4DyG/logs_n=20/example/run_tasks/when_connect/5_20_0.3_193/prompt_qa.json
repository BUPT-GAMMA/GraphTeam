    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 14, 0), (0, 17, 0), (1, 14, 0), (2, 6, 0), (2, 17, 0), (3, 12, 0), (3, 19, 0), (4, 5, 0), (4, 8, 0), (5, 14, 0), (7, 17, 0), (8, 19, 0), (9, 14, 0), (13, 15, 0), (14, 18, 0), (15, 16, 0), (0, 7, 1), (1, 3, 1), (2, 14, 1), (5, 11, 1), (6, 8, 1), (6, 12, 1), (8, 14, 1), (12, 18, 1), (1, 6, 2), (2, 3, 2), (5, 19, 2), (8, 18, 2), (9, 16, 2), (10, 14, 2), (11, 12, 2), (12, 14, 2), (13, 14, 2), (14, 19, 2), (2, 8, 3), (4, 16, 3), (6, 15, 3), (7, 16, 3), (9, 19, 3), (11, 18, 3), (12, 16, 3), (17, 19, 3), (0, 13, 4), (1, 5, 4), (2, 5, 4), (3, 16, 4), (5, 18, 4), (6, 16, 4), (6, 19, 4), (8, 9, 4), (9, 11, 4), (9, 17, 4)].
