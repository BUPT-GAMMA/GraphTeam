    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 4, 0), (0, 15, 0), (1, 4, 0), (1, 7, 0), (3, 4, 0), (3, 10, 0), (5, 9, 0), (6, 12, 0), (7, 9, 0), (10, 16, 0), (13, 18, 0), (14, 17, 0), (17, 18, 0), (1, 13, 1), (2, 19, 1), (3, 8, 1), (5, 10, 1), (6, 7, 1), (9, 14, 1), (9, 17, 1), (14, 15, 1), (0, 2, 2), (2, 14, 2), (3, 9, 2), (3, 15, 2), (3, 17, 2), (3, 19, 2), (5, 7, 2), (5, 13, 2), (7, 19, 2), (8, 17, 2), (8, 19, 2), (10, 18, 2), (11, 14, 2), (18, 19, 2), (0, 13, 3), (4, 7, 3), (4, 11, 3), (5, 14, 3), (10, 17, 3), (11, 15, 3), (11, 18, 3), (0, 6, 4), (0, 18, 4), (0, 19, 4), (1, 11, 4), (2, 7, 4), (3, 5, 4), (3, 13, 4), (5, 12, 4), (7, 17, 4), (10, 13, 4), (10, 15, 4), (12, 14, 4), (12, 18, 4), (12, 19, 4), (13, 15, 4), (13, 17, 4)].
