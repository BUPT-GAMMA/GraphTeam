    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 3, 0), (3, 14, 0), (6, 15, 0), (7, 17, 0), (10, 11, 0), (0, 9, 1), (1, 3, 1), (1, 18, 1), (2, 4, 1), (2, 5, 1), (3, 6, 1), (5, 19, 1), (8, 16, 1), (11, 15, 1), (1, 9, 2), (3, 19, 2), (4, 7, 2), (6, 7, 2), (6, 9, 2), (6, 12, 2), (7, 19, 2), (9, 10, 2), (10, 12, 2), (11, 16, 2), (11, 17, 2), (11, 19, 2), (13, 19, 2), (15, 18, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 17, 3), (1, 12, 3), (1, 16, 3), (1, 19, 3), (2, 15, 3), (4, 11, 3), (4, 14, 3), (4, 17, 3), (5, 15, 3), (6, 18, 3), (6, 19, 3), (7, 14, 3), (7, 15, 3), (8, 14, 3), (9, 11, 3), (9, 18, 3), (10, 18, 3), (12, 19, 3), (13, 15, 3), (14, 18, 3), (0, 2, 4), (3, 7, 4), (3, 18, 4), (4, 16, 4), (5, 6, 4), (5, 10, 4), (5, 17, 4), (5, 18, 4), (8, 15, 4), (14, 15, 4), (16, 17, 4)].
