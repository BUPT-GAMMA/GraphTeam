    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 14, 0), (1, 16, 0), (2, 12, 0), (3, 11, 0), (5, 16, 0), (6, 10, 0), (6, 15, 0), (9, 16, 0), (9, 17, 0), (14, 15, 0), (17, 19, 0), (0, 7, 1), (0, 11, 1), (1, 10, 1), (2, 14, 1), (2, 16, 1), (4, 7, 1), (4, 10, 1), (4, 11, 1), (4, 16, 1), (4, 17, 1), (5, 10, 1), (7, 11, 1), (8, 11, 1), (10, 11, 1), (12, 19, 1), (15, 19, 1), (18, 19, 1), (0, 8, 2), (3, 12, 2), (3, 16, 2), (4, 18, 2), (5, 9, 2), (5, 19, 2), (9, 11, 2), (9, 13, 2), (10, 13, 2), (12, 14, 2), (12, 16, 2), (1, 5, 3), (4, 14, 3), (5, 15, 3), (5, 17, 3), (8, 10, 3), (13, 14, 3), (0, 3, 4), (0, 15, 4), (0, 17, 4), (0, 18, 4), (1, 3, 4), (4, 19, 4), (7, 8, 4), (7, 15, 4), (9, 19, 4), (10, 19, 4), (12, 15, 4), (13, 15, 4), (13, 19, 4)].
