    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(2, 5, 0), (2, 13, 0), (3, 5, 0), (3, 6, 0), (3, 11, 0), (7, 19, 0), (9, 10, 0), (10, 19, 0), (17, 18, 0), (18, 19, 0), (0, 10, 1), (0, 17, 1), (2, 4, 1), (6, 11, 1), (11, 15, 1), (13, 18, 1), (16, 17, 1), (0, 12, 2), (0, 13, 2), (1, 10, 2), (1, 16, 2), (3, 7, 2), (4, 5, 2), (4, 16, 2), (4, 18, 2), (4, 19, 2), (5, 11, 2), (6, 7, 2), (7, 12, 2), (8, 15, 2), (8, 16, 2), (12, 19, 2), (15, 19, 2), (0, 19, 3), (1, 8, 3), (2, 19, 3), (3, 4, 3), (5, 14, 3), (10, 13, 3), (15, 18, 3), (0, 18, 4), (2, 6, 4), (2, 18, 4), (3, 8, 4), (4, 13, 4), (10, 17, 4), (11, 13, 4), (11, 14, 4), (12, 17, 4), (15, 16, 4)]. Find a chronological path starting at node 14 with a length no less that 3. \n",
