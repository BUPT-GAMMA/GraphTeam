    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 10, 0), (1, 15, 0), (2, 15, 0), (4, 19, 0), (5, 12, 0), (5, 17, 0), (6, 11, 0), (9, 10, 0), (9, 13, 0), (10, 15, 0), (11, 12, 0), (11, 16, 0), (11, 19, 0), (12, 15, 0), (13, 19, 0), (1, 2, 1), (1, 11, 1), (1, 14, 1), (2, 17, 1), (3, 4, 1), (3, 19, 1), (4, 9, 1), (4, 16, 1), (6, 12, 1), (7, 8, 1), (7, 15, 1), (8, 15, 1), (15, 18, 1), (0, 13, 2), (0, 19, 2), (1, 12, 2), (2, 4, 2), (3, 9, 2), (3, 14, 2), (4, 12, 2), (4, 13, 2), (5, 9, 2), (7, 18, 2), (8, 9, 2), (10, 14, 2), (13, 14, 2), (0, 15, 3), (1, 4, 3), (2, 6, 3), (2, 12, 3), (4, 5, 3), (6, 19, 3), (7, 14, 3), (8, 16, 3), (10, 12, 3), (10, 16, 3), (18, 19, 3), (0, 8, 4), (1, 9, 4), (1, 18, 4), (3, 12, 4), (3, 17, 4), (5, 8, 4), (5, 10, 4), (6, 8, 4), (7, 10, 4), (12, 16, 4), (17, 18, 4)]. Find a chronological path starting at node 19 with a length no less that 3. \n",
