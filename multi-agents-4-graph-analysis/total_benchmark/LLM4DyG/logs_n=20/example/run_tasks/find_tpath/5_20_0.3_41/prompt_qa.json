    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 2, 0), (0, 18, 0), (1, 17, 0), (2, 15, 0), (3, 16, 0), (11, 18, 0), (1, 3, 1), (1, 8, 1), (3, 9, 1), (4, 19, 1), (5, 15, 1), (7, 15, 1), (13, 15, 1), (14, 15, 1), (15, 18, 1), (0, 16, 2), (1, 11, 2), (2, 14, 2), (5, 13, 2), (5, 14, 2), (5, 19, 2), (6, 8, 2), (6, 10, 2), (9, 10, 2), (10, 16, 2), (12, 16, 2), (12, 19, 2), (15, 19, 2), (0, 3, 3), (1, 5, 3), (2, 4, 3), (2, 8, 3), (3, 10, 3), (4, 9, 3), (5, 18, 3), (7, 9, 3), (9, 15, 3), (11, 14, 3), (0, 15, 4), (1, 13, 4), (3, 8, 4), (3, 14, 4), (4, 16, 4), (4, 17, 4), (5, 16, 4), (6, 12, 4), (7, 18, 4), (8, 15, 4), (9, 18, 4), (9, 19, 4), (10, 12, 4), (11, 12, 4), (12, 13, 4), (13, 16, 4)]. Find a chronological path starting at node 15 with a length no less that 3. \n",
