    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 5, 0), (1, 3, 0), (1, 8, 0), (1, 9, 0), (1, 15, 0), (2, 14, 0), (3, 6, 0), (3, 12, 0), (3, 13, 0), (3, 17, 0), (5, 15, 0), (6, 8, 0), (9, 15, 0), (11, 14, 0), (14, 16, 0), (18, 19, 0), (0, 18, 1), (1, 19, 1), (2, 10, 1), (5, 17, 1), (6, 11, 1), (6, 13, 1), (9, 14, 1), (10, 19, 1), (13, 17, 1), (15, 17, 1), (0, 3, 2), (0, 12, 2), (1, 17, 2), (2, 3, 2), (2, 19, 2), (4, 16, 2), (5, 6, 2), (5, 8, 2), (5, 18, 2), (7, 8, 2), (8, 10, 2), (9, 18, 2), (11, 16, 2), (0, 2, 3), (0, 11, 3), (1, 4, 3), (3, 8, 3), (3, 19, 3), (4, 19, 3), (5, 12, 3), (6, 12, 3), (7, 9, 3), (10, 11, 3), (10, 15, 3), (13, 15, 3), (2, 5, 4), (7, 14, 4), (8, 17, 4), (12, 19, 4)]. Find a chronological path starting at node 2 with a length no less that 3. \n",
