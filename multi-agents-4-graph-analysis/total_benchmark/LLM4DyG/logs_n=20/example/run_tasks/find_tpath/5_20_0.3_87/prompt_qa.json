    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 10, 0), (0, 19, 0), (1, 4, 0), (1, 14, 0), (2, 3, 0), (3, 6, 0), (4, 19, 0), (5, 11, 0), (7, 10, 0), (7, 17, 0), (7, 18, 0), (7, 19, 0), (12, 19, 0), (17, 19, 0), (0, 12, 1), (2, 18, 1), (3, 17, 1), (4, 5, 1), (4, 12, 1), (4, 17, 1), (5, 13, 1), (6, 9, 1), (8, 11, 1), (9, 11, 1), (10, 18, 1), (11, 13, 1), (11, 14, 1), (1, 2, 2), (2, 14, 2), (3, 14, 2), (4, 15, 2), (5, 18, 2), (6, 8, 2), (6, 16, 2), (8, 16, 2), (10, 17, 2), (11, 19, 2), (12, 17, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 2, 3), (0, 5, 3), (1, 5, 3), (1, 6, 3), (1, 16, 3), (2, 5, 3), (2, 16, 3), (3, 4, 3), (3, 13, 3), (5, 10, 3), (6, 11, 3), (7, 11, 3), (8, 19, 3), (9, 10, 3), (13, 16, 3), (16, 19, 3), (0, 17, 4), (3, 10, 4), (3, 11, 4), (3, 19, 4), (4, 7, 4), (5, 7, 4), (7, 13, 4), (7, 16, 4), (8, 10, 4), (8, 12, 4), (8, 13, 4), (10, 16, 4), (10, 19, 4), (11, 15, 4), (12, 18, 4), (15, 17, 4), (15, 18, 4)].
