    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 14, 0), (2, 7, 0), (2, 12, 0), (4, 19, 0), (6, 10, 0), (6, 17, 0), (9, 18, 0), (12, 13, 0), (13, 17, 0), (1, 16, 1), (1, 18, 1), (2, 6, 1), (3, 6, 1), (5, 10, 1), (5, 17, 1), (6, 18, 1), (7, 9, 1), (7, 11, 1), (7, 19, 1), (8, 15, 1), (8, 19, 1), (9, 15, 1), (11, 19, 1), (0, 16, 2), (0, 19, 2), (2, 13, 2), (4, 7, 2), (4, 14, 2), (5, 14, 2), (5, 15, 2), (5, 19, 2), (6, 14, 2), (8, 12, 2), (9, 11, 2), (11, 16, 2), (0, 8, 3), (0, 17, 3), (0, 18, 3), (1, 2, 3), (1, 13, 3), (1, 17, 3), (2, 11, 3), (4, 11, 3), (5, 7, 3), (9, 16, 3), (11, 15, 3), (13, 14, 3), (14, 17, 3), (16, 18, 3), (0, 2, 4), (0, 11, 4), (2, 14, 4), (3, 13, 4), (4, 5, 4), (4, 12, 4), (6, 15, 4), (10, 12, 4), (10, 16, 4), (12, 16, 4), (12, 17, 4)]. Find a chronological path starting at node 19 with a length no less that 3. \n",
