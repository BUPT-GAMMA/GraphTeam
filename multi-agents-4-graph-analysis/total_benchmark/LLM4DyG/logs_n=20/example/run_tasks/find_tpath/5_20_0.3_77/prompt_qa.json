    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 13, 0), (0, 15, 0), (1, 7, 0), (3, 14, 0), (4, 7, 0), (5, 13, 0), (5, 16, 0), (11, 17, 0), (12, 16, 0), (13, 15, 0), (0, 19, 1), (2, 11, 1), (2, 19, 1), (3, 9, 1), (4, 6, 1), (4, 8, 1), (5, 8, 1), (5, 17, 1), (7, 12, 1), (7, 18, 1), (11, 14, 1), (1, 19, 2), (4, 14, 2), (6, 17, 2), (7, 11, 2), (7, 13, 2), (12, 15, 2), (13, 16, 2), (16, 18, 2), (18, 19, 2), (0, 9, 3), (1, 6, 3), (1, 8, 3), (2, 4, 3), (2, 7, 3), (2, 13, 3), (4, 18, 3), (5, 6, 3), (5, 19, 3), (6, 15, 3), (11, 12, 3), (13, 18, 3), (14, 19, 3), (15, 19, 3), (0, 3, 4), (0, 5, 4), (1, 3, 4), (1, 9, 4), (1, 13, 4), (3, 11, 4), (3, 18, 4), (4, 19, 4), (5, 12, 4), (5, 15, 4), (6, 13, 4), (6, 18, 4), (7, 8, 4), (7, 10, 4), (8, 14, 4), (8, 17, 4), (14, 17, 4)]. Find a chronological path starting at node 1 with a length no less that 3. \n",
