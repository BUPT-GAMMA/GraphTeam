    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 13, 0), (2, 14, 0), (2, 18, 0), (4, 6, 0), (5, 18, 0), (6, 17, 0), (7, 8, 0), (8, 10, 0), (8, 19, 0), (9, 16, 0), (13, 14, 0), (13, 17, 0), (13, 19, 0), (1, 18, 1), (4, 5, 1), (4, 10, 1), (5, 6, 1), (6, 10, 1), (8, 12, 1), (9, 10, 1), (9, 11, 1), (9, 14, 1), (16, 19, 1), (18, 19, 1), (2, 9, 2), (3, 19, 2), (7, 13, 2), (9, 17, 2), (11, 14, 2), (12, 18, 2), (0, 16, 3), (1, 8, 3), (1, 15, 3), (2, 6, 3), (6, 13, 3), (6, 18, 3), (8, 9, 3), (8, 13, 3), (8, 14, 3), (8, 17, 3), (10, 15, 3), (10, 18, 3), (0, 4, 4), (2, 12, 4), (3, 6, 4), (6, 12, 4), (9, 19, 4), (11, 17, 4), (13, 18, 4), (14, 17, 4), (17, 18, 4)]. Find a chronological path starting at node 9 with a length no less that 3. \n",
