    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 4, 0), (2, 4, 0), (3, 6, 0), (3, 15, 0), (3, 18, 0), (5, 14, 0), (6, 17, 0), (7, 13, 0), (10, 13, 0), (16, 17, 0), (16, 18, 0), (0, 9, 1), (0, 12, 1), (1, 3, 1), (1, 16, 1), (1, 17, 1), (2, 6, 1), (4, 12, 1), (4, 17, 1), (5, 7, 1), (5, 11, 1), (8, 9, 1), (9, 17, 1), (11, 19, 1), (0, 2, 2), (1, 2, 2), (3, 7, 2), (3, 11, 2), (4, 19, 2), (6, 13, 2), (9, 16, 2), (16, 19, 2), (0, 13, 3), (0, 19, 3), (2, 5, 3), (3, 9, 3), (5, 12, 3), (6, 9, 3), (7, 16, 3), (7, 17, 3), (10, 11, 3), (11, 13, 3), (12, 14, 3), (13, 14, 3), (14, 16, 3), (1, 13, 4), (4, 15, 4), (5, 15, 4), (5, 18, 4), (12, 15, 4), (15, 19, 4), (18, 19, 4)]. Find a chronological path starting at node 0 with a length no less that 3. \n",
