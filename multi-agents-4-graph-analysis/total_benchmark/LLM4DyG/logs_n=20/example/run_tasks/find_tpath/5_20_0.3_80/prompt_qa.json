    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 9, 0), (3, 11, 0), (3, 16, 0), (3, 17, 0), (5, 7, 0), (5, 17, 0), (6, 7, 0), (6, 11, 0), (8, 17, 0), (9, 16, 0), (10, 18, 0), (11, 19, 0), (12, 18, 0), (14, 15, 0), (16, 18, 0), (18, 19, 0), (1, 6, 1), (1, 10, 1), (1, 11, 1), (2, 19, 1), (5, 14, 1), (6, 9, 1), (7, 9, 1), (7, 14, 1), (7, 19, 1), (8, 19, 1), (16, 17, 1), (0, 14, 2), (0, 17, 2), (1, 7, 2), (1, 18, 2), (2, 15, 2), (4, 19, 2), (5, 11, 2), (5, 12, 2), (11, 18, 2), (0, 13, 3), (1, 2, 3), (1, 4, 3), (2, 12, 3), (2, 17, 3), (3, 19, 3), (4, 17, 3), (5, 10, 3), (10, 17, 3), (11, 12, 3), (11, 14, 3), (12, 13, 3), (12, 16, 3), (12, 17, 3), (13, 15, 3), (13, 17, 3), (15, 16, 3), (0, 1, 4), (1, 8, 4), (1, 13, 4), (2, 6, 4), (2, 13, 4), (2, 16, 4), (5, 18, 4), (6, 18, 4), (9, 12, 4), (12, 19, 4), (13, 19, 4)]. Find a chronological path starting at node 12 with a length no less that 3. \n",
