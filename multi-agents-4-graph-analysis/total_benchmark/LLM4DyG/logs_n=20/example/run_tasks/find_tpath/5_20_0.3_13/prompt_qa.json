    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 5, 0), (0, 7, 0), (3, 4, 0), (4, 9, 0), (5, 10, 0), (6, 9, 0), (6, 14, 0), (7, 8, 0), (8, 19, 0), (9, 14, 0), (10, 15, 0), (13, 16, 0), (0, 12, 1), (2, 11, 1), (3, 15, 1), (6, 16, 1), (7, 15, 1), (10, 17, 1), (11, 12, 1), (12, 18, 1), (17, 18, 1), (17, 19, 1), (0, 1, 2), (0, 6, 2), (0, 8, 2), (0, 17, 2), (0, 19, 2), (1, 18, 2), (2, 8, 2), (2, 18, 2), (3, 19, 2), (5, 13, 2), (5, 14, 2), (6, 12, 2), (7, 16, 2), (8, 12, 2), (9, 11, 2), (9, 16, 2), (12, 13, 2), (0, 18, 3), (2, 12, 3), (3, 5, 3), (3, 6, 3), (3, 8, 3), (3, 14, 3), (4, 17, 3), (5, 19, 3), (6, 10, 3), (8, 9, 3), (8, 15, 3), (8, 16, 3), (8, 17, 3), (10, 13, 3), (11, 18, 3), (13, 14, 3), (14, 16, 3), (0, 10, 4), (0, 13, 4), (1, 9, 4), (2, 14, 4), (4, 13, 4), (5, 11, 4), (5, 15, 4), (10, 11, 4), (11, 13, 4), (12, 19, 4)].
