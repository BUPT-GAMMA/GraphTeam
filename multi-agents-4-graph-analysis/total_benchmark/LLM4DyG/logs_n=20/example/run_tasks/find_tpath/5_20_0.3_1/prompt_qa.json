    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 9, 0), (0, 17, 0), (1, 2, 0), (4, 12, 0), (6, 11, 0), (7, 10, 0), (7, 16, 0), (8, 12, 0), (9, 15, 0), (10, 18, 0), (12, 19, 0), (0, 10, 1), (1, 3, 1), (1, 10, 1), (4, 6, 1), (4, 7, 1), (4, 18, 1), (5, 9, 1), (5, 12, 1), (6, 8, 1), (7, 9, 1), (8, 10, 1), (8, 16, 1), (8, 17, 1), (9, 18, 1), (11, 16, 1), (14, 18, 1), (16, 18, 1), (1, 13, 2), (1, 15, 2), (2, 8, 2), (3, 7, 2), (8, 9, 2), (10, 16, 2), (12, 13, 2), (14, 19, 2), (15, 17, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 14, 3), (1, 18, 3), (7, 19, 3), (8, 13, 3), (8, 19, 3), (9, 19, 3), (11, 12, 3), (0, 4, 4), (1, 7, 4), (1, 9, 4), (1, 14, 4), (1, 17, 4), (2, 5, 4), (3, 6, 4), (3, 10, 4), (7, 8, 4), (9, 10, 4), (10, 13, 4), (10, 17, 4), (13, 14, 4)]. Find a chronological path starting at node 2 with a length no less that 3. \n",
