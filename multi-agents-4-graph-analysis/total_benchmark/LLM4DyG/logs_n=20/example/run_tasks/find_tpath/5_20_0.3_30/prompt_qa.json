    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(3, 6, 0), (3, 14, 0), (6, 14, 0), (8, 16, 0), (8, 18, 0), (9, 19, 0), (18, 19, 0), (0, 13, 1), (0, 15, 1), (1, 4, 1), (1, 5, 1), (5, 9, 1), (5, 15, 1), (6, 11, 1), (8, 11, 1), (8, 13, 1), (8, 14, 1), (9, 10, 1), (10, 11, 1), (11, 14, 1), (17, 18, 1), (0, 5, 2), (1, 18, 2), (1, 19, 2), (5, 7, 2), (5, 19, 2), (10, 14, 2), (10, 17, 2), (12, 15, 2), (0, 6, 3), (0, 14, 3), (1, 13, 3), (3, 7, 3), (3, 15, 3), (6, 8, 3), (6, 17, 3), (8, 10, 3), (10, 19, 3), (11, 12, 3), (12, 16, 3), (12, 19, 3), (14, 19, 3), (0, 2, 4), (0, 3, 4), (2, 3, 4), (2, 10, 4), (2, 16, 4), (4, 19, 4), (5, 13, 4), (7, 17, 4), (8, 17, 4), (11, 17, 4), (12, 14, 4), (13, 15, 4), (13, 16, 4), (14, 16, 4)]. Find a chronological path starting at node 8 with a length no less that 3. \n",
