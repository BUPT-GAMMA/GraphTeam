    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to sort the edges in the dynamic graph by time from earlest to latest.\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(6, 16, 4), (9, 19, 2), (9, 13, 3), (2, 13, 4), (2, 19, 3), (1, 11, 2), (4, 5, 2), (2, 5, 4), (5, 14, 0), (5, 8, 1), (9, 15, 0), (6, 11, 0), (0, 3, 0), (10, 12, 1), (17, 19, 3), (0, 5, 1), (14, 15, 1), (8, 11, 1), (9, 10, 3), (4, 15, 1), (0, 1, 1), (3, 18, 4), (11, 13, 0), (8, 14, 3), (12, 17, 1), (8, 19, 4), (8, 12, 2), (1, 5, 1), (4, 10, 4), (6, 18, 4), (1, 2, 4), (12, 13, 1), (13, 18, 1), (8, 16, 3), (5, 10, 4), (4, 13, 2), (10, 16, 3), (18, 19, 3), (13, 14, 4), (2, 11, 4), (0, 19, 0), (5, 17, 0), (2, 8, 4), (2, 16, 3)].
