"In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.
Your task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]
