    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 5, 1), (1, 7, 1), (2, 7, 1), (2, 8, 1), (0, 5, 2), (5, 6, 2), (5, 7, 2), (0, 6, 3), (1, 6, 3), (4, 5, 3), (0, 2, 4), (0, 3, 4), (5, 8, 4), (8, 9, 4)]. When did the three nodes [1, 5, 6] first close the triad?\n",
