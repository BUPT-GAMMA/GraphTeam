    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when the three nodes in the dynamic graph first close the triad. Two nodes with a common neighbor is said to have a triadic closure, if they are linked since some time so that the three nodes have linked with each other to form a triad.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 6, 0), (1, 3, 1), (3, 6, 1), (5, 8, 1), (6, 9, 1), (5, 9, 2), (0, 6, 3), (1, 7, 3), (1, 9, 3), (3, 4, 3), (8, 9, 3)]. When did the three nodes [5, 8, 9] first close the triad?\n",
