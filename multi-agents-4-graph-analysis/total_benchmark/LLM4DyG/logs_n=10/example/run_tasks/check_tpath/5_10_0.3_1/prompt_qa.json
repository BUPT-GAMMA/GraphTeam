    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 9, 0), (1, 9, 0), (2, 5, 0), (1, 2, 1), (2, 6, 1), (3, 7, 1), (4, 5, 2), (4, 7, 2), (7, 8, 2), (0, 1, 3), (1, 6, 3), (5, 6, 3), (0, 4, 4), (3, 4, 4), (3, 6, 4), (4, 6, 4), (4, 9, 4), (6, 7, 4)]. Is the path [2, 6, 7] a chronological path?\n",
