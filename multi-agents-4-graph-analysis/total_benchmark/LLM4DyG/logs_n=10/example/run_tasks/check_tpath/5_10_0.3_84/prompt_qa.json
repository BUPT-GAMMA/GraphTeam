    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 6, 0), (2, 6, 0), (0, 4, 1), (0, 7, 1), (2, 8, 1), (4, 5, 1), (4, 6, 1), (7, 8, 1), (0, 3, 2), (3, 6, 2), (3, 7, 2), (5, 6, 2), (2, 4, 4), (3, 9, 4)]. Is the path [3, 4, 7] a chronological path?\n",
