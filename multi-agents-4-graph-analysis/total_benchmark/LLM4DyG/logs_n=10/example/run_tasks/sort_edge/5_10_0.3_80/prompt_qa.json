    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to sort the edges in the dynamic graph by time from earlest to latest.\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(2, 9, 1), (2, 7, 3), (1, 6, 2), (4, 5, 4), (0, 1, 4), (3, 4, 2), (3, 6, 0), (1, 9, 2), (5, 6, 2), (1, 5, 3), (2, 5, 3), (6, 8, 4), (3, 7, 1), (3, 5, 4), (3, 8, 1)]. Sort the edges in the dynamic graph by time from earliest to latest. \n",
