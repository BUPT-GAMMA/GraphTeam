    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to sort the edges in the dynamic graph by time from earlest to latest.\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 2, 2), (3, 4, 4), (3, 7, 2), (4, 5, 4), (1, 6, 2), (4, 7, 0), (4, 8, 4), (2, 7, 0), (0, 3, 1), (0, 4, 0), (0, 6, 2), (1, 4, 1)]. Sort the edges in the dynamic graph by time from earliest to latest. \n",
