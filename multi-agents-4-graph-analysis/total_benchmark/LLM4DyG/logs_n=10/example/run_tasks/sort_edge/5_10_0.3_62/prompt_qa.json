    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to sort the edges in the dynamic graph by time from earlest to latest.\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(2, 5, 2), (2, 4, 3), (6, 8, 1), (0, 9, 1), (4, 9, 1), (2, 6, 1), (5, 9, 0), (6, 7, 3), (4, 5, 4), (0, 2, 2), (4, 8, 1), (1, 4, 1), (1, 5, 3), (0, 4, 0)]. Sort the edges in the dynamic graph by time from earliest to latest. \n",
