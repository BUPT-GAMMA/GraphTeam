    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to sort the edges in the dynamic graph by time from earlest to latest.\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(3, 7, 3), (1, 3, 4), (3, 5, 0), (0, 5, 1), (2, 9, 1), (4, 5, 0), (2, 3, 1), (6, 7, 4), (3, 9, 0), (2, 8, 0), (3, 6, 3), (4, 6, 1), (2, 6, 4)]. Sort the edges in the dynamic graph by time from earliest to latest. \n",
