    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to sort the edges in the dynamic graph by time from earlest to latest.\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 9, 1), (3, 8, 4), (0, 4, 2), (1, 2, 4), (4, 5, 1), (2, 5, 1), (5, 9, 2), (0, 8, 2), (7, 8, 1), (4, 9, 2), (6, 9, 1), (7, 9, 2), (1, 3, 3)]. Sort the edges in the dynamic graph by time from earliest to latest. \n",
