    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether three nodes in the dynamic graph formed a closed triad. A closed triad is composed of three nodes which have linked with each other some time. \nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 9, 0), (1, 2, 0), (2, 5, 1), (3, 7, 1), (4, 8, 1), (0, 1, 2), (0, 8, 2), (3, 6, 2), (5, 7, 2), (1, 4, 3), (4, 6, 3), (4, 9, 3), (6, 9, 3), (3, 9, 4), (4, 5, 4), (5, 9, 4), (6, 8, 4)]. Did the three nodes [6, 3, 9] form a closed triad?\n",
