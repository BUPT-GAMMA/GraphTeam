    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether three nodes in the dynamic graph formed a closed triad. A closed triad is composed of three nodes which have linked with each other some time. \nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 2, 0), (2, 4, 0), (2, 7, 0), (4, 6, 0), (5, 8, 0), (1, 4, 1), (2, 5, 2), (0, 1, 3), (0, 2, 3), (0, 5, 3), (2, 8, 3), (2, 9, 3), (4, 8, 3), (6, 7, 3), (1, 9, 4)]. Did the three nodes [0, 2, 5] form a closed triad?\n",
