    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether three nodes in the dynamic graph formed a closed triad. A closed triad is composed of three nodes which have linked with each other some time. \nGive the answer as yes or no at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 3, 0), (3, 4, 0), (3, 6, 0), (5, 6, 0), (0, 7, 1), (1, 8, 1), (2, 7, 1), (2, 9, 2), (7, 9, 2), (1, 5, 3), (2, 6, 4), (3, 5, 4), (6, 9, 4), (7, 8, 4)]. Did the three nodes [9, 7, 2] form a closed triad?\n",
