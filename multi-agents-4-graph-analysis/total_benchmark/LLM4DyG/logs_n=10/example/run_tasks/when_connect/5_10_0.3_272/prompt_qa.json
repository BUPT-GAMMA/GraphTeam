    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(3, 4, 0), (4, 7, 0), (6, 9, 0), (0, 7, 2), (1, 6, 2), (2, 9, 2), (1, 4, 3), (1, 7, 3), (3, 7, 3), (7, 9, 3), (1, 8, 4)]. When are node 4 and node 3 first connected?\n",
