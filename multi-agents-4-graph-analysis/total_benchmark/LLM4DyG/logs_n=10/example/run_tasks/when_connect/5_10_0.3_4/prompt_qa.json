    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 4, 0), (0, 5, 0), (2, 5, 0), (0, 2, 1), (1, 4, 1), (1, 7, 1), (0, 1, 2), (1, 2, 2), (1, 5, 2), (3, 9, 2), (8, 9, 2), (1, 6, 4), (3, 5, 4), (4, 6, 4)]. When are node 4 and node 0 first connected?\n",
