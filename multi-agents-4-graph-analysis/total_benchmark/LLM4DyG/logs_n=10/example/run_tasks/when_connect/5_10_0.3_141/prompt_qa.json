    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer when two nodes are first connected in the dynamic graph. Two nodes are connected if there exists a path between them.\nGive the answer as an integer number at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(1, 8, 0), (2, 6, 0), (2, 9, 0), (3, 4, 0), (0, 2, 1), (0, 4, 1), (2, 4, 1), (8, 9, 1), (0, 7, 2), (0, 6, 3), (2, 8, 3), (4, 8, 3), (4, 9, 3), (1, 4, 4)]. When are node 3 and node 4 first connected?\n",
