    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(3, 6, 0), (4, 7, 0), (4, 8, 0), (0, 7, 1), (0, 9, 1), (1, 4, 1), (3, 4, 1), (5, 9, 2), (6, 7, 2), (1, 9, 3), (2, 6, 4), (2, 9, 4), (7, 8, 4)]. Find a chronological path starting at node 3 with a length no less that 3. \n",
