    "prompt": "In an undirected dynamic graph, (u, v, t) means that node u and node v are linked with an undirected edge at time t.\nYour task is to answer whether a path is chronological in the dynamic graph. The time of the edges in a chronological path from source node to target node must not decrease, e.g., [2, 3, 5] is a chronological path in the dynamic graph [(2, 3, 0), (3, 5, 1)]\nGive the answer as a python list at the last of your response after 'Answer:'.\nQuestion: Given an undirected dynamic graph with the edges [(0, 6, 0), (1, 9, 0), (2, 4, 1), (2, 9, 1), (3, 9, 1), (0, 1, 2), (0, 8, 2), (3, 4, 2), (3, 6, 2), (3, 7, 2), (4, 7, 2), (5, 8, 2), (0, 3, 3), (3, 5, 3), (6, 8, 3), (0, 4, 4), (3, 8, 4), (4, 8, 4), (5, 9, 4)]. Find a chronological path starting at node 0 with a length no less that 3. \n",
